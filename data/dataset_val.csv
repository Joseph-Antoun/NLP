The value is acceptance of the right a person has, to live their life in a way that brings them happiness, as long as it does not negatively affect others, without being discriminated against and marginalized.   The same could be done to fat people, or anyone that is making a choice in life that is different from someone else's. One would be a hypocrite to accept one but discrimitate against an other. That is the definition of the european value here, and one could say that yes, it is in fact european. There is literally no valid excuse for marginalizing or hating gay people. ",europe

30380,"&gt; (emphasis mine). IF. They don't though.  They do. Here's the Netherlands : Judges are appointed by the Crown, under the aegis of the Minister for Security and Justice. Only Dutch nationals can be appointed to the office of judge. Candidates must hold a law degree from a Dutch university.  I'm not entirely familiar with the Polish law and how it would exactly work, but a lot of the systems require the Minister of Justice to make judicial appointments. This is exactly what the problem is here, isn't it? I mean, I'm aware that the international narrative is pushed differently, but is there are real substantial reason for that? This system is a matter of constitutional legal basis for Poland, and regardless of which party is in power, it will still be in place in this form. So the question is, is the narrative justified on the basis of the devised appointment system or is it something else?  &gt;sn't that what is being done? The other EU countries are saying that what Poland is trying to do won't fly.  Doesn't matter what they say or think. If objectively their systems doesn't hold itself to a higher degree, then the commonly held standard is a somewhat minimum level, a level which Poland would be legally satisfying. Article 7 requires there to be an infringement of those values.   If Poland wishes to appeal against the invocation of Article 7, it goes to the CJEU. Then the CJEU needs to make an assessment of how the appointment happens in each state, and how that differs in this case for Poland. If the CJEU finds that there is no substantial and material difference between all the systems, and that it works essentially more or less the same, then Poland is deemed to have satisfied the basic requirements of democratic system and rule of law that is part of the EU acquis.

2353,"**Start watching the minimap NOW.**  The minimap is your window of opportunity.  It lets you see opportunities to help a fight, it lets you see opportunities to avoid getting killed, and it lets you see opportunities that may be developing (such as the skull and crossbones that indicate that dragon is alive, or the fact that 4 of the enemy are heading towards middle tower and you probably need to be en route to help defend).  If you have access to a timer that you can make beep every 5 seconds, do so, and every time it beeps check the minimap.  At least *glance* at it.  But make it a habit that is as natural as breathing.  **The minimap will save your life.**  If there was a second thing, it would be to play selectively aggressive.  By selective, I mean to pick the safe times to play aggressively.  If you carefully select when you want to play aggressive, you will discover more about your champion.  You will learn to spot opportunities to be aggressive, and you will learn to detect those signs of aggression in the opponent.    **The best way to die is when an enemy gets away with 15 hp but you died.**  On a larger scale, the best way for your whole team to die is if you all died but still managed to kill 4 of their team.  I say that's the best way because you tested your limits.  You learned something about your character, or the enemy, or *something* that might help you survive with 15 hp next time and the *enemy* dies.   The third pitfall to avoid is to spend a moment thinking about what you want to build, browse the shop, and find what you want to buy.  In other words, get familiar with the items and think about why you would want to spend hard-earned gold on any particular thing.  On the topic of builds, don't be upset if someone criticizes your build.  *They could very well be wrong.*  Or they could be right.  Again, think about why somebody might be making a recommendation, and work from there.  However, if you are locked in to some build you found online, you will foolishly ignore even good advice and limit your own growth as a player.  Guides are *great*.  Guides can show you opportunities that you've missed, or give you new ideas to work off of.  However, they are inflexible.  If you blindly follow guides, the day will come where you will follow it to your own doom.  Don't start with guides.  You will fuck up and you will do great, but do it with your own brain.  Finally, and this one is big, **farming will never let you down**.  That's why so many people say ""last hitting creeps is #1 tip"" but it really isn't the #1 tip.  Farming is earning gold for getting the last hit on a creep.  The goal of the game is to bust down the enemy nexus, and the most reliable way to do that is to be stronger than your opponent.  You get stronger by earning gold and experience.  Every creep that the tower kills or that you allow the minions to kill is a missed opportunity to get slightly stronger than your opponent, and that advantage grows throughout the game.  If you ever think farming is weak, check the scoreboard when there seems to be a single player that's dominating the game.  I bet you 500 Riot Points that the player who is doing the dominating will have the highest number of creeps killed.  PS - attack speed is not a great stat to stack.  If you're working on an AD character, consider balancing attack speed, damage, crit %, armor penetration and **survivability** such as Banshee's Veil.",leagueoflegends

Arguably the first group to popularize shibuya-kei from underground circles, they also later on began experimenting with the style, with what some called an innovative genre all their own, blending traditional Japanese pop, alternative, soul, funk, jazz, ye-ye, acoustic folk, and early electronic music, among others. They are also perhaps best known to audiences in the west in their later incarnation as a duo of Nomiya Maki (野宮真貴) and Konishi Yasuharu (小西康陽).  &gt; They are widely credited to have spearheaded the ""Shibuya-kei"" movement of Tokyo in the 90s, along with Flipper's Guitar.   &gt; They are known for their eclectic and energetic compositions, which often sound like ""new"" releases from the late 1960s hipster scene. Their catchphrase--""A New Stereophonic Sound Spectacular""--captured the group's ironic stance but eager attitude. The group broke up in March 2001.  &gt; A hugely prolific group, Pizzicato Five would release at least an album-per-year along with various EPs and remix albums during their 16 year-career.  &gt; Both Nomiya Maki (野宮真貴) and Konishi Yasuharu(小西康陽) currently enjoy solo careers - with Konishi Yasuharu(小西康陽) producing other artists ranging from Puffy and SMAP to Cornelius and kahimi karie(カヒミ・カリィ) - alongside collaborative remix compilations - from Ella Fitzgerald and The Supremes to classic Disney and Thunderbirds (as in Super-Marionated) music on his Shibuya-based Readymade Records label.    &gt; On Thursday March 31st, 2011, exactly 10 years after Pizzicato Five disbanded, Konishi Yasuharu announced a new solo project called Pizzicato One.  The first release, titled One and Ten Very Sad Songs, consists of covers of English songs, each featuring vocals by various internationally-known artists from around the world.

It must be tough being the least popular team in Texas, but it’s understandable when you have to compete with the Cowboys, Spurs, Astros, and any high school football team.    Your mascot is named after a color you made up. That is somehow dumber than retiring the Number 1 for your fans.     Jamie Benn looks like a pudgy manchild who stopped puberty halfway through, and his on-ice behavior indicates as much too.       Tyler Seguin's career is much like the Stars as a franchise; he won a cup with virtually no effort on the back of a team someone else built.      Fuck Norm Green.     The Dallas Stars don't make Youth Sized jerseys because the CPSIA classified Stars jerseys as a choking hazard. Though it's hard to fit a 200 pound 8 year old into a Youth jersey anyway.     Gary Bettman doesn't want to put a legitimate NHL franchise in Houston because then Dallas would want one too.       Fuck Norm Green.       Antoine Roussel makes Brad Marchand look like Johnny Gaudreau.      You are the worst of the non-traditional hockey markets.       It seems redundant to have introduced some goofy big-eared alien looking fucker when you signed Jason Spezza a couple months earlier.       Norm Green is worse than Stan Kroneke.      With the signings of Antti Niemi, Patrick Sharp, and Johnny Oduya, you guys basically became Blackhawks South. Except unlike Carolina, there's nothing endearing about your team, and people don't actually want you to succeed.       2001 was a terrible year for American Airlines, namely due to a single, catastrophic event. On that fateful day in 2001, they tragically opened up a building with their name on it, that became home to the Dallas Stars.       Your Stanley Cup win only happened because of bad officiating. Buffalo was right.     Fuck Norm Green.     [“Hey Patrick, what am I now?” “Uh, stupid?” “No I'm a Stars fan!”](http://imgur.com/a/jUKio)     The Dallas Stars, with their high flying offense, and terrible defense, have been compared to a car that is the front half of a Lamborghini, and the back half of a minivan. The car can still function, but it's hard to drive as it has no clutch.       Jim Nill traded Jyrki Jokipakka, Brett Pollock, and a 2nd Round Draft Pick, for 23 games of Kris Russell, in which he got 8 assists, and a +- of 0.     There’s the saying that goes “Shoot for the moon, and even if you miss, you’ll land among the stars.” With the recent signings of Martin Hanzal, Alexander Radulov, Marc Methot, and Ben Bishop, it’s seemed to take on another meaning. “Shoot for the Stanley Cup, and even if you fail to win it and are all over 30 years old, you'll get overpaid by the Stars.""

One of the first things I did was make the conscious decision to go out of my way and change that aspect of my life. For me, this happened around 8th grade. I ended up joining the Legislative Debate team in order to bolster my public speaking skills and learn to talk to people. This taught me how to speak and maintain conversations with people, however, it didn't really help with gaining friends and learning how to meet new people. What helped me with this was moving from Michigan to Missouri for college. This forced me wayyy out of my comfort zone and basically left me with the choice to go out of my way and make friends, or know nobody there. It was a rough first couple of weeks, but it taught me how to find common ground with almost anyone, regardless of whether we are similar in personality. It also taught me to be more open to new experiences, as doing something that someone else is interested in/passionate about can go a long way in making friends.  TLDR: Joined debate, moved states, and tried new things to build my social skills",AskReddit

10779,"Okay, my previous answer was not the most serious one, and that's my fault, I'm sorry. I'll try to explain my reasoning and object your criticisment on some points.  &gt;And that's an easy way of saying that the medium is already laughed at by the majority of people, what is another awful, weird, perverted piece of trash to the already negative stigma.  That's not the only reason anime is still stigmatized today. It's a combination of the previous generation not understanding that hand-drawn animation can show a complex and mature story, and the general ""japanese are weird because I automatically believe that their weirdest shit is common amongst them"" mentality. Hentai didn't help either in creating a positive picture about anime. Compared to these, trashy harem shows don't contribute as much to the stigma as you think. Most people who hold up this stigma don't even know these shows exists.  &gt;You didn't call them stupid, but you somehow implied that when it became about incest it is somehow worse than the already inherently sexist bullshit that is harem.  I did not want to imply that it became worse. Probably something has gone missing in translation (English is not my first language). I wanted to express my distaste of having an acceptable background story and setup sinked in order to give more ground to the siblings', at the very least, questionable relationship. As for the harem genre: I do not find the setup bullshit. I find it something well within in the borders of disbelief - I know it's unrealistic and 99% of the time it's a power fantasy intended for the audience, but it's not impossible in terms of reality. This is why I can't really describe it as a sexist genre, either: it's blatantly obvious that these girls (or guys, let's not forget about reverse harems) don't exist in real life and they are not intended to be a example to be followed, but they still don't break my suspension of disbelief, and I do believe that it's the same for the majority of the watchers of the show.  &gt;However, there are plenty of series out there that do what Eromanga does but better, maybe not a lot better, but better. At least those shows have a modicum of storytelling and character development that actually affects the flow of the narrative. Why not watch those? That way you are promoting entertainment that at least has some value to this looping industry.  It was not my intention to defend Eromanga-sensei over other shows even in the same genre. I was not promoting it either. I just said that I liked it. Look at this thread: the original theme is about shows that are popular on this subreddit, but the original posters of the show have a disagreement about this. That's where I wrote my shortened experience with the show. I did not recommend it, nor did I asked people to not watch it. Actually, I have another comment in this thread about Kuzu no Honkai and even when I have strong negative feelings about the show, I stayed neutral in it's recommendation.   &gt;I don't look for different things in different pieces of entertainment. I look to be entertained. That's it. If i'm not entertained then I can analyse why.  That's perfectly fine, but...  &gt;However, genres really don't have much to do with that.  Yes they do. Genres have a different set of tropes which are to be used, discarded, subverted, etc., and as such give us the story. But you can't have the same valueing system for two different sets of tropes. That's like complaining about a marble statue not being colorful enough.  &gt;Studios really don't matter. They don't. Some have their signature trademark or directors and that's great and they can bring their own personal touches to otherwise over-done ideas.  Yeah, I should have said that studios don't really matter in a meaningful way, but since there is difference in experience staff and overall style between them, it's important to mention them as a factor, even as a small one. For example, Inferno Cop and Ninja Slayer from Trigger, the animation is lacking to say the least, but it's acceptable from Trigger, since it's their style. I wouldn't accept the same quality from Madhouse or KyoAni.  &gt;But once again, if those touches/ideas aren't inherently entertaining to the critic, why give leniency?  Because not every critic thinks like you or me. Their aim is to reach a majority of approvement among the critics. If this does not happen, then yes, it was a mistake from them, but if it happens, it'd hurt the industry to prevent them from continuing it.  &gt;It does to me. And since i'm only speaking for myself, then I have every right to say that it brings nothing to the table because it honestly doesn't to me, or to anyone who has a critical eye for anything.  And here we are again. Continuing from the previous point: Not everyone thinks the same, but you don't realize that. You think of yourself as an objective criticist, but you're really, really subjective. You think that only your opinion can be critically acclaimed, and that's inherently wrong.  &gt;You can fucking watch paint dry and gain some entertainment out of there somehow. Doesn't mean that it offers anything. It just means you found it entertaining, and just like anything, you might just not have any standards for anything.  I do have standards and preferences. Even if it does not look like it, I have them, just as every other person. I just have different levels of them for different subjects, as I have explained earlier and I think this is right for the abovementioned reasons.  &gt;But don't try pass that off as something people who do have a critical eye for entertainment or any standards whatsoever should try to understand.  Again, I did not do that, I just stated my opinion about the subject.  &gt;You can always pass something off as ""fun"" and that's where the conversation ends. Goodbye. It's fun. Great. Now if you want to talk or criticize something and when your own ideals get argued against and all you do is go fetal and repeat ""it's fun"" over and over again, a conversation doesn't happen and you come off as someone who's wildly insecure about their own tastes as well as completely disingenuous with your own criticisms of anything.  Of course I'm not going to defend Eromanga-sensei. Shit's not worth it. That's why you don't criticize wrestling for being fake, for example. Everyone who is connected to it knows it. Just as everyone knows that if you want to enjoy Eromanga-sensei, you have to lower your expectations. It's not worth more than ""fun things are fun"".  As I'm writing again, I just expressed my personal feelings about the show, and I didn't defend any of it's aspects in my original comments. I did defend the respective genres in my response to you.   I am EXTREMELY insecure, good realization. Not about my tastes, though. I know what I like and I'm fine with it.  I did avoid having a proper conversation with you about it. I'm sorry, again. Hope this reply is good enough.  &gt;7019 characters  Holy shit that's a lot of text.   [](#shitposting)",anime

13550,"I'm not sure you read the links you provided properly. The OED confirms what I said. The definition it supplies is ""Treat (someone) as a child or in a way which denies their maturity in age or experience"" - you distorted this by cutting it off. Moreover, all of the examples provided by the OED concern humans: ‘No one infantilizes adults more than the conservatives and the extreme right'.  The MW definition is far less clear and offers no examples. What is does do is connect the word to the the word 'infantile', which is obvious, but tells us nothing.   Finally, if we google 'infantilize the debate' we get a total of 5 results. Of these 3 are comments by users and 2 are from the same article reproduced on two different websites. This is consistent with the incorrect usage of a term.  I'm all for the flexible usage of language. However, if we want to retain language as an effective tool of communication, there have to be limits. My argument here is in fact not that the author doesn't use a human object to the verb. 'Infantilise' is a very aggressive term. It implies a removal of control, not simply the distortion of one's arguments. A man might infantilise his wife if he talks down to her as if her opinions have the intellectual value of a child's. Similarly, we might infantilise a nation if we assert that they cannot survive without their colonial oppresors. But the Economist is not asserting that the Germans are immature and need a grown-up to take charge. They simply disagree with the German perspective on trade surpluses and, at worst, are a bit dismissive of the arguments that support that perspective.   Nobody is infantilising anybody else here.

I could go on and on and on.  Cabinet positions are entirely at the discretion of the PM and rarely have anything to do with qualifications  .  So for a PM to use that power to appoint a cabinet that better reflects the diversity of Canada is entirely appropriate.  You can argue the values of a meritocracy, but our cabinet has never been one.    Nope, the people choose the MP's, not the government, that's a pretty important distinction.

DeVaughn was a salaried government employee as a drafting technician (according to Casey Kasem,[citation needed] he designed sewers), part-time singer,[1] and member of the Jehovah's Witnesses.[citation needed] He wrote ""[ ""[ A Cadillac Don`t Come Easy eventually re-written to become""Be Thankful for What You Got ""(song)|in 1972, and spent $900 toward its development to Omega Sound [A Philadelphia Production House][2] The producers at Omega [Frank Fioravanti and John Davis wanted to go for a nasty groove and wrote an smooth arrangement ,eventually booking time to record at the famous Sigma Sound Studio in Philadelphia Remarkably, the session featured members of the MFSB group - guitarist Norman Harris, drummer Earl Young, bassist Ron Baker, and vibist Vince Montana - these top musicians were secured by Allan Felder, who also developed the separate adlib back -up chorus with his Sister`s vocal choir. .[3]Frank Fioravanti, could have released the record on the companies own label Sound Gems but it was just starting out and instead secured its release on the Roxbury Records record label..&gt;[4] The record sold nearly two million copies on its release in spring 1974, reaching #1 on the U.S. R&amp;B charts and #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, selling a million copies.[5] With a sound and content influenced by Curtis Mayfield, its simple and encouraging lyrics hit home, to the extent that it became featured on gospel radio stations. When his success as a recording artist seemed guaranteed, DeVaughn quit his government job. DeVaughn released an album, featuring mostly songs of an overtly religious character, and the second single, ""Blood Is Thicker Than Water"", made the R&amp;B top ten and the pop top fifty later in 1974; ""Give the Little Man a Great Big Hand"" had minor success early the next year.[6] Live, DeVaughn preached to and admonished his audience from the stage. He lost interest in the music industry not long after, working in a record store and again as a draftsman. Fioravanti kept Devaughn under contract hoping to eventually get recording again but it wasn`t until 1980 that they would hook-up for new projects. Fioravanti made a mistake by giving the new album Figures Can't Calculate' to ' (TEC Records) included the title song, which was a minor R&amp;B hit, and a remake of ""Be Thankful for What You Got"".TEC never paid out any royalties. Still though soon after Devaughn recorded another Fioravanti tune ""Creme de Creme "" released in Europe on the ""Red Bus"" label. Until this point in time Fioravanti produced or co-produced all of the singles and albums.  &gt; In 2004, DeVaughn released a new single, ""I Came Back"", on his own Mighty Two Diamond Records.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  &gt; In 2004 he released a new single, ""I Came Back"", on his own Mighty Two Diamond Records.  &gt; In that same year, rapper Ludacris sampled this song[dubious – discuss] for ""Diamond in the Back"" on his album Chicken and Beer.

48957,"lol wut... have you heard of this thing called hemp?  Its quite useful, and poses a huge threat to vested corporate interests. In fact, hemp was once the largest and most important industry in the United States, even before the US was a country.   Facts:  The first 2 copies of the Declaration of Independence are on hemp paper, a paper which proves to be superior in nearly every way to tree pulp based paper.  Ethanol from hemp is far more carbon efficient than corn based biofuel, plastics from hemp are biodegradable and stronger than petroleum based products. In fact, [this](http://hempcar.org/ford.shtml).  Hemp seeds contain lots of amino acids and vitamins and are considered a ""superfood"".  Cordage and fabric from hemp are much more durable than their cotton counterparts.  Cultivation of hemp has lasted as long as human civilization and it is one of the most useful and important crops we have. However, it is profitable to some corporate interests to have weed be illegal, every industry where hemp has a potential application as a competitor product will fight to keep it illegal because such a transition would be expensive and destabilize the market.

First of all he has to think about adding players to fit into the team's offensive and defensive schemes. Not all players are ideal matches for your team.   Secondly in order to field a full roster, he has to account for filling every position which means you're  drafting players who wouldn't necessarily be first or high second round draft picks, i.e. a long snapper or punter, etc.  If you're not drafting for those positions as well, instead filling those roster spots with undrafted free agents, then ultimately several of those 52 picks would be cut anyway.",nfl

44904,"Courtesy of /u/Blobbles890:  &gt;I've developed a pretty solid hatred for the Oilers. Mostly because I'm from Edmonton, and let me tell ya, the amount of ""fans"" that popped up and bought a shitty orange McDavid jersey and wore it around was unbelievable. It was like the Oilers have been everyone's team for the past few decades or some shit, but nope, everyone pops up, pretends like they watched the team since before last Tuesday, posts a couple of pictures of Rogers Place watch parties on social media, and pisses everyone and their dog off, but nobody says anything because everyone else is on the bandwagon too. I get that the team is good again and that's fun and all, but fuck if it wasn't shoved down everyone's throat for a month and a half. It wasn't unbearable or anything, but fuck, you'd think people who haven't watched hockey in their lives have better ways to spend their money than a jersey they'll wear twice, probably not realizing Adidas was dropping new threads on us two months later anyways. And then they'll all chirp the shit out of me for being a Wings fan because all of a sudden we're bad and they're good now, apparently the ultimate trump card. Yay.  &gt;Then there's the whole mismanagement draft lottery thing. I'm not a huge fan of the draft lottery like it was, but the Oilers singlehandedly ruined the draft lottery for every other team because of their idiotic management. Four first overalls later, and idiotic management which sent the city into a collective state of angst, and the NHL changes the rules. Who loses from that? Colorado, who got 4th overall despite being historically terrible; Buffalo, who got Eichel, but whiffed on other great talents; Vancouver, who are in a permanent state of 5th overall; Arizona, who haven't had jack shit compared to other teams in the draft, and just about every other team near the top of the draft lottery. Who doesn't lose from the rules specifically made to limit the Oilers? Well, you fuckin guessed it, it's the Oil. They just ride off into the sunset with Mc fuckin Jesus and continue to monopolize generational talent along with the Penguins, who deserve their own angsty rant that I'll save for another time.  &gt;On top of that, how can you cheer for some of the guys in the Oilers organization? Kevin Lowe ""knows a thing or two about winning,"" but helped drive the team and the city's collective morale into the ground. Darryl Katz has some weird sexual lawsuit, and strong armed the city into building the arena over the threat of dumping the Oilers in Seattle. Arena is nice, but fuck, even hardcore Oilers fans agree that taxpayer dollars shouldn't really be going to an expenditure which benefits that goof above all else. Like, fuck, his team was so bad, that the city of Edmonton basically collectively adopted his son when we saw him march up to the draft stage for a top pick every year. It was like watching your own child grow up or some shit man. Katz alone should probably keep any non-Oilers fan around here from liking the Oilers, so I guess I'll leave it at that until the next time I get into a Hall/Larsson debate and take the edgy, indefensible position that the Oilers maybe could've gotten more value in that deal. Yay once again.  &gt;Disclaimer: the Oilers fans I know would probably laugh at this, hopefully I don't pull too many strings, it's all for fun boys, even though I do really not like the Oil  ",hockey

I'm curious how you can put a fixed time span on persons turning around their character.  Two years... because what?  He hasn't done anything douchey in two years?  What steps has he taken to amend his wrongs?  What actions has he done to contribute to society?  IIRC he even said something at the end of his Comedy Central Roast about him going to try to be a better person.    Look at someone like Chris Brown.  Chris Brown has a laundry list of abuse.  I'm sure I don't have to remind you how he beat the shit out of then girlfriend Rihanna.  To those of you who think, ""no big deal""... http://www.ibtimes.com/chris-brown-police-report-leaked-brown-continued-punch-rihanna-face-his-right-hand-while-steering  He beat the shit out of her because his girlfriend saw a text from another woman while they were driving.  Threatened to kill her.  Threatened to continue beating her after they got home.  Now, he's got a documentary out called ""Welcome to My Life"", showcasing all of trials and tribulations.  Poor guy. But its been 2 years since his last incident, so he's back to normal status.  This is one of thousand of examples throughout the decades across all genres of celebrity status.  If Bieber, Brown, Lennon, Jackson, West, etc. etc. didn't have their celebrity status, they'd be douche bags.  This worship of famous people for simply being famous normalizes poor and destructive behavior, make it seem like its not only OK, but often ""cool"" to their millions of fans.  I get it.  Do I feel for Bieber?  Sure do.  I did crazy stupid shit as a teen and young adult too.  If i had tons of money and women throwing themselves at me at his age, its very likely I'd have done the same shit.  But because I feel for him, because I understand his reasons, it doesn't make his behavior acceptable.    Staying off the radar for two years or talking about how you will change in the future doesn't magically get rid of that vinegary smell.  Its about actions, about doing.    What has he done with intent to show people he's not a douche, to show people that part of his life is in the past.  Nothing. ",Music

34593,"There are a few issues that they have, that Netflix isn't bound by Canadian Content Laws, that they rely on the infrastructure of communication corporations like Bell, Rogers, Shaw and Telus, who are pretty much the main competition to Netflix in Canada, and that they run a strictly on-demand service.  The first issue is pretty easy to understand, Netflix isn't currently required for its library to carry a certain percentage of Canadian content, and they aren't required to help fund Canadian content creation.  The second issue is also easy to understand. Obviously as a strictly internet based company they have no need to build their own infrastructure like the incumbents have.   The third issue, and probably the biggest of them is that Netflix offers on-demand services, they don't just broadcast channels like the incumbents do, who supplement with on-demand channels. Everyone in Canada would LOVE ""a la carte"" programming, where you only pick the channels you want, but that isn't economically feasible for these companies, which is why you have to buy a basic line-up and then get extra packages. Netflix can bypass this because they only license specific shows, and do not license network access and the content that comes with that network.  I have no issue with the Canadian Gov't telling Netflix they have to start offering up a specific amount of Canadian content, but that is where I draw the line, Netflix isn't a broadcaster.",canada

I'm writing our 32 teams/32 day posts as we speak, but here's what I wrote of Jameis to give you a teaser:   **QB- Jameis Winston:** Jameis Winston exceeded expectations in his first two years, becoming the first player in NFL history to throw 4,000+ yards in his first two seasons. It hasn’t been without significant issues with turnovers, however. In 2016, Winston had the 2nd highest number of interceptions among active QB’s, with 18 picks (6 lost fumbles in addition), completing the ball to the defense in 11/16 games (four of which were multi-pick games). It didn’t help that Winston was limited by a sheer lack of weapons, narrow WR depth, and an offensive line who didn’t do him many favors. A lot of these roster deficiencies were addressed this offseason in signing D-Jax,  drafting Howard, and drafting Godwin. As his rapport continues to develop with his existing targets in Evans, Humphries, and Brate, I’m expecting a big leap in year three for him. *Probably Wrong Projected Stats: 4,353 yards, 61.3% completion percentage, 32 TD’s, 14 INT’s* ",nfl

Outside the top 4 teams in England, no team has as many supporters as us, and arguably the top 4 only have that many fans because they win things which has drawn in large numbers of 'supporters' from the Far East etc.  Granted, the league as a whole is not that big but you're trying to compare a league in a country of about 5 million people to one of about 50 million, at least make a fair comparison. Half of the teams in the SPL are from towns of less than 80,000 people for christ sake, whilst not a single team in the EPL is. The Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Irish and Croatian leagues are far fairer comparisons, and the SPL matches up to them very well.   That explains why we are currently at the standard we are - there is a much smaller market and so much less money, and so we cannot afford to or indeed attract big names. In the past decade we have performed far, far better than our financial situation should have allowed us to. If Celtic and Rangers moved to England with the fanbases we have, the massive increase in revenue we would receive as a result would propel us into being top teams.  In summary, KakarotsKid, I think I could probably speak for most Scottish football fans and say that we are quite glad that you don't have an interest in Scottish football, because quite frankly your views on it are incredibly simple-minded. And anyway, we don't watch the SPL because we're looking for a high quality of football - we're not the EPL, or La Liga, or Serie A, and we never will be and we're well aware of that - we watch the SPL because we support our teams no matter what.",soccer

44688,"The theater experience isn't inferior as a fact, but it is less desirable for many. It's an opinion thing. There's a large part of the market that would go to the theater less or not at all if they'd have the option to watch new movies for a decent price at home. Others prefer going to the theater, or only go for a couple dates / family outings a year and would continue to do that even if offered the option of viewing a new movie at home.  Watching at home gets you the benefits /u/WeylandTheDwarf mentioned and more. It can save time (travel, organisation especially with kids), money (from condiments, parking, travel), it can prevent the annoyance of loud or obnoxious theater goers (phone screens, talking / yelling, popcorn throwing, people walking in and out) and provides more freedom (to pauze, talk / discuss more freely, choose own beverages / foods, watch the kids / be there if they need anything).  Watching in the theater is more about going out, it's a bit more of an event, the quality of picture and sound can be better (depending on the theater and the home setup), and at least for now, you get to watch newer movies.  I'm pretty sure both preferences are strongly present in the market - enough to warrant offering movie fans the choice (with movies screening in theaters and at home at the same time), instead of theaters having a monopoly on new movies. I say let the consumer choose - theaters will end up with the audience that specifically wants to be there, which should be enough for them to survive (though possibly in downsized form). And movie studios can make good money from theaters and from streaming home release, if the business model is well thought out.  I don't think big studios will be quick to work with Netflix for new movies, but over time, and with Netflix offering the right price / business model (like a per-movie fee or premium subscription that works for all parties), it may happen. Or another party, like a consortium of movie studios or another third party besides Netflix could get it done at some point. The theater-only window is anti-choice and archaic in my opinion, even though I have nothing against the theater and go several times a year.

But by far the most chilling tale was from when he was working in a very secluded area of wilderness and was walking through the forest when a thunderstorm hit. He had seen a opening in the hill a little while back and headed to it to take shelter. Once inside he shined his flashlight to check he wasn't going to wake up a bear or something and found the skeleton of a man, sitting in a lawn chair, with a rifle rigged up so he had been able to shoot himself. The skeleton was still wearing jeans and a flannel shirt.  I've met a lot of bull shitters in my time and this guy wasn't one, he'd honestly just led an interesting life. ",AskReddit

He has so many reasons to be inducted that I won't even start listing and instead I'll just go straight for the major knock against him which is that he only did so good because he was playing for a good team, which is complete and utter bullshit. First, he also played for the Islanders and the Blues and still had a winning record with those teams. Look at what's happened to those teams since he played for them. Basically right into the crapper (not trying to knock you Islanders and Blues fans, just pointing out facts).  You may say that doesn't matter much because he played much more time for the Wings. To that I say you still have to play like a champion if you want to become one. Look as recently as last year and you can find plenty of examples. Luongo is one of the best goalies in the league and played for the President's Trophy winners, but god was he bad on the road in the playoffs. Bryzgalov, another excellent goalie, let in 4 or more goals every game in the playoffs this year and played for a pretty solid club. Point being, you don't just win because you're on a good team and even if you've done well in the past, it doesn't guarantee you'll win today. You have to go out and earn every win no matter who you play for or what your reputation is. That's what Osgood did.  The fact that he did it for so long and at such a high level while becoming a champion three times along the way proves it to me that he should be in the Hall of Fame.",hockey

Subsequently, those companies made a lot of money of those shares for which they did not pay taxes in Russia or the States.  In early 2008 HSBC and Hermatige were accused of committing fraud against the Russian treasury.  This was before Magnitsky events.   Browder's office was raided because of these investigations... concerning the fraud that occurred against the Russian treasury.   Magnitsky was not a lawyer.  Magnitsky was an accountant. He did not turn any documents concerning corruption, he was investigated after being named as a co-conspirator by one of the people that were found guilty of defrauding the Russian treasury.  That is why the offices got raided, and that is why Magnitsky was interrogated twice.   There is a great documentary that Browder is having censored in the West that goes over the official story, and looks at the actual evidence and interviews the people involved.

The band was formed in late 1993 by lead singer/guitarist Britt Daniel and drummer Jim Eno. Current members also include: Eric Harvey (keyboard, guitar, percussion, backing vocals) and Rob Pope (bass, backing vocals - replaced Joshua Zarbo in 2007).  &gt; After releasing their debut LP Telephono on Matador Records, the band signed with Elektra in 1998, but the contract was dropped soon after the band released A Series of Sneaks. In response the band released a two-song single titled The Agony of Laffitte (referring to Elektra A&amp;R man Ron Laffitte). Eventually they signed to Merge Records.  &gt; Spoon has been met with widespread critical acclaim. Girls Can Tell, released in 2001, sold more copies than both their previous releases combined. Kill the Moonlight accomplished the same feat a year later. Gimme Fiction was released on May 10, 2005 and continued the trend of increasing popularity for the band.  &gt; Britt Daniel wrote much of the soundtrack to the 2006 film Stranger Than Fiction. Four tracks by Spoon are also featured.  &gt; The band released their sixth studio album Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga on July 10, 2007; those who purchased the first pressing also received a bonus disc titled Get Nice!.  &gt; Transference is their seventh studio album. It was released on January 18, 2010 in Europe, and on January 19 in North America, to moderately positive reviews.  Read more on Last.fm.

It was going to be awesome, overnight, in cabins, by a lake, with boys. I had the permission slip turned in, a sleeping bag bought, and I was more than ready to go. 1 week before the trip I was on the playground bouncing a basketball, and some little jerk took it away from me. I went and told my teacher to tell him to give it back because he stole it from me, and he wouldn't, he said, you can get it back yourself. At the time he was my favorite teacher, but this infuriated me, I got so mad that I called him a butt hole for not getting the ball for me. He kinda laughed and I said, no I'm serious. That jerk wrote me up and I wasn't allowed to go on the camping trip! It was so ridiculous, especially since I had never been written up before and was a straight A student. I still run into him to this day, and his wife is my hairdresser, but my blood still boils when I see him. He deprived me of a great childhood memory!

Statistically the DTaP is one of the most dangerous vaccines on the market, in a leaked pharma memo, a pharmaceutical essentially admits that bad batches of this vaccine cause SIDS and then recommends to split the batches up so as you don't get a cluster of deaths in the same area which can easily be traced to the vaccine.  i.e. instead of fixing the vaccine, he was happy to continue sending out the dangerous vaccine as long as they don't be caught.  http://i.imgur.com/0GV1ZgI.jpg  [Full Story - Proof that Big Pharma Doesn’t Care About Vaccine Harm ](http://gaia-health.com/conventional-medicine/pharmaceuticals/proof-big-pharma-doesnt-care-vaccine-harm/)  The so-called 'anti-vaccine' side gets misrepresented by the mainstream media, they are constantly setting up an 'anti-vaccine' strawman and then knocking it down with industry marketing and propaganda disguised as science.    I've been involved in this for many years, going deep into the research and the debate, the major problems are that vaccines aren't being tested properly, nor is the schedule, unvaccinated people aren't being studied, vaccines are being studied one at a time, not using real controls in safety studies, not looking long-term.  In 2017 vaccines are a shot in the dark!  The only way to work out what's going on is to do the research for yourself, as the system and media has been setup by Big Pharma.  That means going to the independent experts, not Big Pharma vaccine patent holder (i.e. making millions from vaccines) 'experts' like Paul Offit who the mainstream media go to.  I've posted up presentations from the independent experts below, anyone who watches those all the way through will never vaccinate again.

In fact it is decreasing the global sea levels since it is binding ~200-600 gigatons of water per year. We would need tremendous warming for it to start melting even a little and raise the sea level.  Calving only tells us that we have had colder climate in the past. We all know this, it is called the little ice age. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Ice_Age  ",conspiracy

The duo produces original material amalgamating various styles including 2-step, house, hip-hop and soul and also host a radio show on Ministry of Sound Radio entitled ""Follow the Bears"". Critics offer various descriptions of The 2 Bears' sound including ""pop-hip-house"", ""liquid-bmore-house-step"" and ""rave-garage"". The 2 Bears have received UK national radio support from DJs including Fearne Cotton, Scott Mills, Nick Grimshaw, Greg James, Annie Mac, Huw Stephens, Kissy Sell Out, Dev, Rob Da Bank and John Kennedy. The duo have produced remixes for several established artists including Santigold, Metronomy, Toddla T and The View.  &gt; Raf Rundell, a former press officer, and Joe Goddard, one fith of electronic music band Hot Chip, met while working together at the Greco-Roman soundsystem parties. Joe has told how the band originated from the suggestion of a friend who proposed that he, Raf and Joe Mount (from the band Metronomy) form a band called 'The 3 Bears'. The band ultimately formed as a two piece without Joe Mount. During their formative studio sessions Raf &amp; Joe created the tracks 'Mercy Time' and 'Be Strong', which went on to appear on their first EP 'Follow The Bears', released by Southern Fried Records in early 2010. 'Follow The Bears' was supported by a subsequent remix EP featuring contributions from Derrick Carter &amp; Supabeatz. The Bears went on to release a further two EPs on Southern Fried Records, 'Curious Nature EP' in the latter part of 2010 and 'Bearhug EP' in early 2011. Both were accompanied by further remix EPs with contributors including Maxxi Soundsystem and Midland. The 2 Bears first complete album Be Strong was released on January 29, 2012, and was preceded by the single 'Work' on January 2. The single was included on the XFM playlist. They also made a mix album, 2 Bears 1 Love which featured Wiley, Toddla T, and remixes from the 2 Bears. They also announced a second LP titled 'The Night is Young' was to be released in September 2014 on Southern Fried Records. Read more on Last.fm.

Members of an emerging movement called scratch music (or turntablism), this crew keeps working on finding original sounds and knows how to benefit from its technical control to put forward some musical quality which makes its identity. Each member uses his turntable as an instrument, recreating in turn drums or bass guitars, scratching a riff of guitar or shearing the brass... to lead to a general harmony such as bands made up of instruments known as ""traditional"".  &gt; C2C has obtained in September 2006 its fourth DMC team world champion title in a row. With their previous victory in 2003, 2004 and 2005 they achieve a historical quadruple and break Dj Craze's records, the only Dj that has made it 3 times in a row until today... This crown is in fact the result of a keen upstream work: while taking part regularly in competitions, they make progress and make a clean sweep of the best ranks as they also won ITF 2005 team world Champion title and Hip Hop World Challenge title. Pfel, the last Dj getting in the crew, round off this prize list by his collection of trophies won in solo competitions (DMC, ITF). This rise leads them in parallel to perform all around the world with Q-Bert, A-Trak, Dj Kentaro, The Scratch Perverts or DJ Vadim. Exploiting at the very maximum human as well as material possibilities (mixers effects, feedback, larsens...), the show presented on tour is out of breath for the listener. The denseness of sequences is cut by technical parts meant to underline individual performances. Routines give way to live compositions mixing turntables of one, machines of another finish brilliantly with the 6 minutes sets having made them champions of the world four times in a row!   &gt; On the creation side, the quartet excels too and particularly in realizing pieces intended for producing. Thanks to their various experiences and after a long soundgrubbing work, they launch out a whole series of breakbeats entitled Flyin' Saucer (3 volumes to date) including several own innovations. A recent proof of their qualities in this field: 20Syl and Greem, respectively Mc and DJ of the band called Hocus Pocus, invited the two others C2C Djs to take part in its new album 73 Touches (On And On records). This collaboration has just led on a track completely played with turntables. They're now working on their first album which will lead them to a further step in their artform. Read more on Last.fm.

You can find them with several names, here at Last.fm: Medeski Scofield Martin and Wood and Billy Martin, Chris Wood, John Medeski &amp; John Scofield are some variations possible. The band received some of their first significant exposure outside of the New York City jazz scene by performing with Phish at their October 14, 1995 concert, which led to the association of the group as a jam band. In addition, their performance on John Scofield's 1997 album A Go Go helped to further their exposure. The band collaborated further with Scofield again in 2006, releasing the album Out Louder under the name Medeski Scofield Martin &amp; Wood. This was the first album released on MMW's own Indirecto Records. Medeski Martin &amp; Wood's first performances together were at the Village Gate, a popular New York jazz club. They were initially an acoustic jazz trio, but Medeski added a Hammond organ when the difficulties of touring with a piano became apparent.  Their first album, Notes from the Underground, is a record of their entirely-acoustic era. All of their subsequent albums reveal Medeski's use of a wide variety of keyboards, including mellotron, melodica, and a clavinet. Wood entirely eschewed the electric bass for MMW's first three albums, and still relies heavily on the acoustic upright bass in recordings and during live performances. Their earlier albums reveal a Hip Hop influenced updating of classic soul jazz sounds, which is the primary theme of their well-known 1996 album, Shack-man. From 1998 to 2005, MMW were signed to leading jazz label Blue Note Records, and showed them delving deeper into dense, electronic funk than their earlier albums, although the band continued to experiment with free jazz and free improvisation both on their albums and in concert. In 2001 MMW performed several songs for the Red Hot Organization's compilation album Red Hot + Indigo, a tribute to Duke Ellington, which raised money for various charities devoted to increasing AIDS awareness and fighting the disease. Medeski Martin &amp; Wood's live performances are renowned for their exploratory nature. Their concerts usually involve extended improvisations, which may be both arrhythmic and atonal, an aspect of their musicianship that is rarely documented in the studio. They occasionally tour using only acoustic instruments, reverting to the instrumentation that they began their career with. Their album Tonic is an example of these more contemporary acoustic performances. They have also done short tours of entirely improvisatory performances. These shows usually consisted of two sets of improvisation, followed by an encore of a song from an album. Read more on Last.fm.

57090,"Something this epic happened to me once. I was a little crazy as a youth (15 years old) and I got sent away to be evaluated at a hospital and they would up drugging me and I woke up in some ward and they kept me there for 3 weeks. Then I was able to go home for the first time.  I went down to my room, which was in the basement and I was stuck there as a bunch of adults sat upstairs. I knew that I had some weed, somewhere, even if it was only rez. Then I realized that I had nothing, no papers, no lighter...nothing. Feeling like shit, I decided to search everywhere and I eventually stumbled upon a CD case with a pack of rolling papers in it. Minutes later I found a lighter. It was a little frustrating because I now knew that I had everything in the making except for the weed. I had no escape from the basement, but the basement had windows. All I needed was some herb, even if I just found a roach, I could empty it into the new paper. I had been nearly a month without smoking, I knew that shit would get me high.  So I am digging through all my drawers and I began to notice small accumulations here and there and I start to put them together. This may be the smallest joint ever, but it *will be* a joint.  So I began to realize how hard it is going to be to roll this thing. But I have nothing but time on my side. I figured I could really take my time and produce a perfect little pin-joint that will probably burn to ash within 2 hits. But I *would* get two hits.  Fuck. This is going to take a while. I should put on some music. I press the CD-tray eject to put in a CD but nothing happens. WTF? I begin to try everything, from sticking a knife into the ejector to banging the top of the player. Nothing works.  O' Hell No. You can take my weed God, but you wont take my music too. Not today. I unplug the CD player and begin to go nuts trying to get the ejector to open. Now that it is unplugged, I really cram the knife into the slit and I begin to work that shit. Remember, this was back in the 90's where the CD went on a little tray that sucked in and out of the machine.  So I get it to budge and I grab the tip of the CD tray. I am pulling but it feels like something is stuck. As I yank, I realize that there *is* something stuck inside the CD player.  I then get a flashback to the last 15 minutes before being sent away, my parents bugging out, me thinking I needed to find a place to hide my stash. A place that nobody would ever find it. I was also at a solid [10] while planning this out, because I knew that they may try to keep me at the hospital for more than a night, I knew my parents tricks.  As I finally get the CD tray to come out, what do I see? A huge quarter of bud in a plastic bag that is nearly ripped to shit.   Looking back at it, 13 years later, I know that I really needed that humongous joint that I ended up smoking. Saved my life really.",trees

So the way I see it Jonah has multiple personality disorder. One being Jonah who's religious, kind and saved. The other being Buster the hermit Y2K conspiracy theorist. They both wanted to leave but Jonah couldn't leave his family and he was too poor to take him with him. Buster was impatient, so he disguised himself as the drifter from the hotel and used Jonah to help him get money to take their family and leave. After Jonah yelled at Buster in the car Buster got pissed because he knew that Jonah would give up on their dream for his family. So Buster came back appealed to Jonah then betrayed him and killed his wife and daughter. I would say the drifter is a 3rd personality but I'll tell you why I don't think so later.  After the funeral he splits into Buster and Jonah. A year or two passes and Buster either forgets about Jonah or doesn't give a shit until he's on the bike and sees the religious program. Buster knows that being a hermit wasn't the right choice so he comes into contact with Jonah. Jonah went and faked his death and lived on the boat to search for answers from God then gets dismayed. When they met, Jonah tried to kill Buster not only because he hates himself but because Buster killed their family.  Its not much but I think it's better than nothing. I think the psychic was supposed to symbolize that people just hear what they want to hear.   A friend of mine decided that Jonah woke up on the beach with his family because he took them on a real vacation and passed out. I like that theory too",movies

Due to the local political contingency, the artist went into exile in 1976, living in Panama, Italy, and Spain. A show called La Gran Vuelta de Piero (The Great Piero's Return) was set up to celebrate his comeback in 1981. That performance was recorded and released as a double album titled Calor Humano.   &gt; In 1985, Piero started touring all over Latin America along with musician José Toherkaski. A side project to help teenagers from modest families became his major goal soon after.   &gt; In 1995, Piero produced a charitable record to help Unicef on its fight to protect children rights, getting contributions from artists such as David Gilmour, Joaquín Sabina, Annie Lennox, and León Gieco, issuing Canciones Blindadas in 2001, comprising old songs and previously unreleased material.

The most radical of them have spent the last seven months poring over the WikiLeaks, stocking their bunkers with fact-based nonsense that will make PizzaGate look tame, and developing a guerilla media strategy that's light years ahead of the antiquated bullshit that lost the last election for the Dems.  This is no more than the Dems deserve. As a Green--which is a dissident populist progressive party in USA--I have no particular love for either of them anyway: both sides are consumerists.

A large portion of which was spent getting guys jobs where they were treated and compensated fairly. It was a tough but rewarding gig. My point was to simply say that if a depth receiver had committed Vick's crime, and served his sentence, he almost certainly would not have gotten a job afterwards. Vick ONLY got that opportunity because he was at one point in time a transcendent player.   I think you're making a few hiccups. First, all crimes are not viewed equally. For whatever reason people are more apt to hire a theft or drug offender rather than a murder offender. This in spite of the statistics OVERWHELMINGLY showing that people with chargers of murder 1 are the best parolees and have the most successful lives after prison. It's unfortunate but in our current climate (it's probably getting worse honestly) it is what it is. Second, do not fool yourself into thinking the american criminal justice system is rehabilitative. It is strictly punitive. Any rehabilitation that happens is fought for tooth and nail by social workers who are under staffed, under resourced and under paid. ",nfl

He was not yet an adult and was too young to fight, but assisted his brethren in various ways - cooking, first aid, repairing armor, etc. One of the Wildhammer gryphon riders noticed him and sensed a potential within him. He talked to Volkh and told him that in Aerie Peak were dwarves that could teach him how speak with the elements and serve a greater purpose.  After the war, Volkh went to Aerie Peak with the Wildhammer to study and learn their shaman traditions. Ten years later, after Deathwing attacked Azeroth, he had completed his training as a Shaman and returned to assist the Ironforge and the Alliance, and Azeroth itself. He has continued in his craft as a jewelcrafter, mostly as a hobby, but has learned that he was using the elements to coax the gems from the rock naturally.  *EDIT: If we can ever actually play as subraces, I'd probably change Volkh to be a Wildhammer from the start.* ",wow

Bozak (4.2m) could be replaced, &amp; Jvr (4.25m) will likely be traded/let walk.     After that its all rather minor things. A decision with Leo (2.9m) is likely the hardest one, but Moore, Leivo and Carrick would headline the UFA/RFA after that.   So cap space becomes available and a 1 year Thorton becomes a possibility (32.3M of space available as of today), especially considering Bozak (who is very weak defensively) is gone. Babcock knows Thorton and his abilities.   I honestly do not know if it will happen, but the Leafs will likely be looking for a rock solid 2 way 3C to replace Bozak, unless they have Nylander switch to C and push Kadri down the line.

I do know where my fruits (including grapes) and vegetables are grown, and I have been to the quite a few wineries in the area whose products I buy.  Other parts of the EU could probably do better in terms of transparency, but they do a great job around here.  In my opinion you are full of shit.  The EU is not finding ways to ban imports from the US.  The companies in the US are refusing to comply with laws because they can make more profit by not doing so and selling domestically.    EU food standards protect those 510 million people, and the food regulations in my region are even more strict than those mandated by the EU.  Keep thinking it is because they fear competition.  Why do European foodstuffs command such high prices in the US?    How much does real Parmesan from Parma, Reggio Emilia, Modena, Bologna, or parts of Mantua cost?  They have been making this cheese for over 800 years with the same methods.  If anyone was allowed to make Parmesan there would be no way to control quality, or to make sure that people aren't producing sub-par cheese with the name Parmesan.  Most regional delicacies are protected for this reason among others.    Putting Parmesan into google I get a shop selling their cheapest for $23.27 per kg, and the most expensive selling for $49.11 per kg.    https://www.parmashop.com/english/parmigiano-reggiano.html  I think it is a fantasy to say French, German, Spanish, Italian winemakers feel threatened by American ones.  We can still export everything else from the US, but we don't in high volume because it simply doesn't sell.  The price to performance ratio is not a good one.  You could sell Shiraz, but the South Africans make a better one.  You could sell Riesling, Mueller-Thurgau, or Dornfelder, but the Germans make a better one.  You could sell a Chardonnay or Bordeaux, but the French make a better one.  You could sell a Barbaresco or Chianti, but the Italians make a better one.  You could sell a Rioja or Gran Reserva, but the Spanish make a better one.  Of course taste is subjective, but you would be arguing against the collective sommeliers of the world.  California makes some good wine, but the price to performance is simply not palatable.  You have your opinion, and I have mine.  I'm honestly flattered that you call my reality a fantasy.",europe

41559,"I dunno about 30-40 years, putting such numbers is basically just guesswork.  But look at it another way:  You say 1 out of every 4 dollars is produced in the US. That means 3 out of 4 dollars aren't. Changes in that ""rest of the world"" thing are weighted 3x for every 1 of ours. That's a lot of money that could go to industrialization, commerce, research and development, etc.  In reality, that ""rest of the world"" is really just the EU plus a small number of other countries - Japan, China, India, Brazil, Canada, South Korea, Taiwan, and a few more.  As he mentioned, last year 92 countries had growth rates above 4%. China and India were at 10%+, Brazil at 7.5%, South Korea at 6.1%. Even first world countries like Germany, Japan and Canada had higher growth rates than the US, which was number 117. And yet the US produced a 2.8% growth rate, which is pretty darn respectable for a mature economy.  So it's not like we're doing very poorly, it's just that many countries are doing a hell of a lot better. This is understandable, since they have a lot of room to grow; many started off with 3rd world status and many are still there.  But the net result is that the US share of all those things you mentioned, such as the 1 out of ever 4 dollars we produce, or the amount of military that cash can buy, all go down *as a fraction of the total world output*. And this can happen pretty damn fast.  More worrying to me than dollar amounts and number of military bases are things that I think are better predictors of future performance, such as:  1. Number of research papers we produce per year. This is **far** from keeping pace with the growth in the rest of the world.  2. The performance of American kids in math and science and basic reading comprehension skills, in which we placed 29th out of 31 of the top industrialized countries in the world.  3. Deteriorating infrastructure - roads and bridges which are not being built at a pace in keeping with population growth, which are not being kept in repair. Telecommunications in which we lag far behind many European and Asian countries.  Stuff like that has serious consequences if you're making predictions about the future, because it's your growth pipeline, it's what will fuel tomorrow's growth.  Again, nobody is saying the US has lost already, just that the current trend is a decline rather than maintaining the status quo or advancing. Yes, we ""control space"" as you said, but people looking at NASA today which just retired the shuttle, visited the moon 40 years ago and never went back since, continues to cut back for lack of funds, can't help but think that this is exactly what ""decline"" looks like. We had the whole market in space launches once along with the USSR. Today, commercial satellite launches are more likely to be through ESA or the Japanese, or the Indians.  I don't think this trend will go away, because really our massive dominance over the rest of the world was something of a fluke of history that gave us a huge lead over everyone else. Europe was the only competition, and it was crushed after WW2. Asia was coming out of the feudal/dark ages. You couldn't expect that sort of thing to last forever.",worldnews

United Kingdom requires Each firearm to be registered on a Firearms Certificate (FAC) or shotgun certificate, and bans semi-automatic rifles and handguns.

Our results are striking and sobering. They suggest that public opposition to any further migration from predominantly Muslim states is by no means confined to Trump’s electorate in the US but is fairly widespread.  &gt;In our survey, carried out before President Trump’s executive order was announced, respondents were given the following statement: ‘All further migration from mainly Muslim countries should be stopped’. They were then asked to what extent did they agree or disagree with this statement. Overall, across all 10 of the European countries an average of 55% agreed that all further migration from mainly Muslim countries should be stopped, 25% neither agreed nor disagreed and 20% disagreed.

68900,"&gt;Surely you can agree that we're likely to be our own undoing?  How so?   We were likely to be our own undoing according to Erhlich in his ""Population Bomb"". He is famous for having been wrong about every single prediction he ever made. And not in a small way.  During that period, almost all ways of measuring human existence have improved.   Doomsday predictions have existed since crops experienced rain during harvest and a guy blamed it on another guy who had a wife that was too hot. They have never come true. Killing the guy and fucking his wife did nothing to improve the likelihood that rain wouldn't fall during the next harvest.  If you want to have a discussion on a conspiracy sub about our march towards human degradation, perhaps you may want to discuss people like the Rockefeller and their affiliated groups who all push their hundred trillion dollar climate change scheme and how people could instead be empowered to determine their destiny instead of being lead by power obsessed psychopaths.

When landing a plane there is a console known as the inertial guidance system. The purpose of the system is to get the plane within one thousand yards of the runway for landing the plane. Each time the plane strays off course, the system corrects it. The pilot explained that they would land successfully despite ""having been in error 90 percent of the time."" Emery take it from there, stating: ""So the path from here to where we want to be starts with an error, which is correct, which becomes the next error, which we correct, which becomes the next error and so on"" So the only time we are truly on course is that moment in the zigzag where we cross the true path.""",AskReddit

The band currently consists of Mette Lindberg (vocals), Lars Iversen (bass, keys), Mikkel Baltser Dørig (guitar, keys), Miloud Carl Sabri (trumpet, keys) and Rasmus Valldorf (drums). Their debut album, Fruit was released in 2009 on their own Small Giants label. The band's single Around the Bend was featured in an iPod Touch commercial in December 2008.   &gt; Speaking with Songfacts in an interview, Iversen explained how the song got in the Apple commercial: ""We have this company working for us in the States called Synch, and they got in touch with Apple. I think they had this meeting with Steve Jobs himself, and he picked that song out of the bunch and said, 'This is it, this is the new track for the iPod Touch.' Apparently he just loved that track, but we never saw it as one of our singles. We have some other songs that we thought would be great singles, and that would work cool on for the radio, but he really loved that song.""    The Asteroids reached instant global exposure when their song Around The Bend was featured in an Apple iPod Touch advert in late 2008. Their music also appeared in US hit TV series Gossip Girl, CSI Miami as well as Chuck. Around The Bend was also chosen as one of the key tracks to the R.J. Cuttler documentary ""The September Issue"", based on Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour.   &gt; Their song The Golden Age is featured in the latest Heineken advert The Entrance from 2011.  &gt; Their first show ever was as opening act for Amy Winehouse in their local Copenhagen and Katy Perry chose The Asteroids as opener for her European tour summer of 2009.

Only the solution to go anywhere in space involves the conscious mind of the person going there. Quantum does not include consciousness in its model, it's utter bullshit.

I'm not sure where I developed this fear, but since I was a kid it was something that kind of freaked me out. I'd always feared that something could explode and send shrapnel or a valve into my face and possibly break something or go straight into my brain.   I did some research online and found very few stuff about [genetic memories] (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/10486479/Phobias-may-be-memories-passed-down-in-genes-from-ancestors.html) which at the time was basically mocked and called a pseudoscience.   I then also found out that I'd gotten the fear from my dad, who when he was young, was moving some pressurized containers, and another soldier was using them for some reason when somehow one burst in front of my dad and sent a valve flying into the guys face, breaking several bones, and my dad rushed to help with about 3 other guys, the dude was choking on his own blood and it was a very bad situation. Dad never told me what else happened to the guy or if he lived or not, just know that's where I might've gotten that fear from. My dad would be extremely cautious and weary around them, and kind of go around a corner to do other work when people would start fiddling with them.   I still have this habit...when my dad turns on the propane tank on the grill to start grilling some meat I get really paranoid and go to check up on other stuff inside or what not. I fucking hate being close to them for some odd reason. I can still do work with them, it doesn't stop me, but if I can avoid it, I avoid it.   It's probably irrational, but you know, I'm paranoid around them.   edit: Seeing [these] (http://cen.acs.org/content/dam/cen/94/17/06-9417notw2.jpg) makes me feel kind of uneasy in real life for some reason.

Delivered but not in service, that's different.   &gt; The French are currently flying the Rafale M, a mid-1990's design, and Super Entenards, a early 70's design. They can techncially handle the standard US NAVY fighter/strike aircraft, the F/A-18 Super Hornet (designed in the mid 90's).  The Super Etendard has been retired from service.  &gt; So, comparing the Rafale M to the Super Hornet, no, I don't think anyone at all would say the Rafale is superior in any way, even before you factor in that the F/A-18 is a fighter and a strike aircraft.

27688,"Sigil of Misery, Sigil of Silence and if you're a blood elf - arcane torrent are the ways to deal with them. Play with Quickened Sigils and pop one just before they finish their cast (and start channeling).  Most important of all - plan out everything before it happens. Download DBM Challenge mode - it has pretty accurate timers for abilities. Go out of Variss' pool 5-6 seconds before arcane adds are about to spawn so you can drop your debuff and reenter when they spawn. I did not know this at first but self healing *does* generate threat, go smack Variss with a Soul Cleave / Spirit Bomb and they will come to you.  Make some macros - button to focustarget Variss and one for Kruul and then Imprison/Consume magic macros that are cast on your focus target, regardless of your current target. I found myself getting killed by Mind Blasts while having high Decay stacks so I made a weakaura that tracks his cast so I can use my defensives or Imprison appropriately.  If you need more tips I would love to help.  Edit: Recalled some more things:  For the Kruul phase - use the focustarget macros to interrupt Twisted Reflections (if you don't make it grab an orb immediately or he will heal). Make/download a weakaura that tracks that and makes a sound (the airhorn works really well). I was usually double jumping, not gliding, most of the time to make it faster/easier to glide out of the fel pool when it does hit. It's not super big damage but a few millions could be useful to have.  Most important thing in Kruul phase (after proper mitigation of course) is abusing the fact that **Kruul can be imprisoned**. This does not fully negate an annihilate cast - it still happens shortly after he breaks free but it gives you some time.  CDs for Annihilation - Spikes on first, Spikes + Brand on second, Meta + Spikes on 3rd, Last Resort on 4th or just hope Kor'vas SOMEHOW manages to take aggro and eat a stack which does like 5% hp to her.

People online at this time is usually doing some WQs before going to work. He left soon after to a more progressed guild, was booted from that guild after a week.  Hunter that apparently was a very very lonely dude, he required attention and something to do every time, he played overwatch, HotS and League with different guild members, he ended up leaving the guild to play black desert online full time because he met some people there that played more than us, sorry we cant play 24/7.  Priest guy that was a little bit under geared for my taste but was given a shot because he seemed like a decent player. First two weeks of Tomb he goes to every boss kill we do in normal and heroic as the average ilvl from our raid was 917 atm, he gets from 885 ilvl to 920 pretty easily, gets ""sat"" in the first night trying Mythic Goroth because as a healing officer i wanted to know if 4 healers were enough for this even though it doesn't have a enrage timer, got whispered a second after making the decision asking me what his standing in the guild was and that he is insecure if we are even gonna take him into Mythic, raid lead had to talk to him for a solid 15 minutes to explain the meaning of mythic raiding, having a good ""Comp"" and sometimes being sat for fights. Didnt last long after that.  The thing that blows my mind the most is when new recruits and trials complain and ask for gear on the first night they are brought in, like ""why did that guy got the piece if it was a better upgrade for me"" well because in the great scheme of things that piece was due to that guy because it completed his 2 set or his 4 set, allowed him to use a BiS legendary, many reasons, you just dont go and in your first week in a new job, ask for a raise.  There is a lot that the guild leadership has to take into account, if you are gearing to kill bosses sometimes an ilvl upgrade for someone is not a good reason to give them loot yet.  I hope you end up finding a guild that fits you, in this game finding a place that you can call home makes it more enjoyable but dont forget that the guys in charge are also people and that they can make mistakes and the best way to find a solution is to talk, find the officers share your thoughts in a good way if they are good and decent people they will hear you and even fix the problem that you are having, communication is the best thing you can have in a guild.

And let's play devil's advocate here, and assume that his direct presence was absolutely integral to the plot. Was him sitting down and being completely passive the best way to express his power and utility in the universe? If he had played a part similar to his role in The Avengers, everything would've been accomplished all the same, but if for some reason he absolutely needed to appear, taking action, and a possible show of force would have been all the more effective.

How about the fact that The Jungle Book was carried by a child (any celebrities were just voicework).   Here's the problem, it's these actors, in this movie. Now I'm not familiar with the source material, but the trailers give me the impression that these two are like the best mercenaries in the business, and I just don't believe it. They're too young to have the experience/wisdom of anyone else, too cocky to want it more than anyone else, and frankly to small to be a physical threat. Everything that I saw highlighted that these two were super experienced, but they were also getting out of conflict by the skin of their teeth.   I think this would have worked better if they were played up as *inexperienced*, who manage to overcome great odds. I don't blame the actors for the director's decision to cast them as super soldiers, and I know that's where my negative opinion of the film came from based on the trailers.   That, and it just looked cheap. I know the consensus seems to be that the CGI is incredible, but it just... isn't. Just about every blockbuster this year has had more convincing special effects.   But I don't think any of that explains why this one failed with general audiences. For them, there was no hook. Besson? No. Just. No. Where is the story, what is this world *about*? The most successful films with GA make you care about what's going on in the story in a 2 minute trailer, so you're interested to see the whole thing.

33039,"[Todd Marinovich's father](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marv_Marinovich#Strength_.26_Conditioning_coach)  &gt;He has never eaten a Big Mac or an Oreo or a Ding Dong. When he went to birthday parties as a kid, he would take his own cake and ice cream to avoid sugar and refined white flour. He would eat homemade catsup, prepared with honey. He did consume beef but not the kind injected with hormones. He ate only unprocessed dairy products. He teethed on frozen kidney. When Todd was one month old, Marv was already working on his son's physical conditioning. He stretched his hamstrings. Pushups were next. Marv invented a game in which Todd would try to lift a medicine ball onto a kitchen counter. Marv also put him on a balance beam. Both activities grew easier when Todd learned to walk. There was a football in Todd's crib from day one. ""Not a real NFL ball,"" says Marv. ""That would be sick; it was a stuffed ball.""[5]",nfl

Here are a few suggestions:  **Which server should I play on?**  Pick a medium to high level server that focuses on your preferred playstyle (PvP, PvE, RP). If you have friends that play, join them on their realm!   **What's changed since I last played?**   Unless you played in the current expansion, pretty much everything has changed. If you're returning after a very long break, check out the [WoW Returning Players Guide](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/returning-players-guide).

There is no ""best"" race / class / spec combination, they change all the time with balancing. Play what you want to play and don't worry about it.   **Can I farm enough gold in X days to pay for my sub?**  Maybe? It depends on how much time/dedication you have. Check /r/woweconomy for all things gold making, just don't ask 'How do I make gold?'.  **Should I play?**  We don't allow ""sell me on WoW"" posts, such as ""should I start playing?"" or ""should I come back?""

68424,"Right, but the imports come with the money and the professionalism. There's care taken these days to give the imports time, to give them familiarity, to make them feel welcome and supported. That didn't used to exist, because orgs were just random opportunists and teams were just gamers playing together.  And in EU, to a large extent, that's still true. Fnatic, G2 and Misfits seem pretty organised (UoL too, to a lesser extent) but many of the LCS teams don't have much in the way of structure or investment - they just live split-to-split, and when someone gets an offer from a better side, or starts playing like shit or whatever, the teams gets relegated and the org disappears.  The NA scene hasn't just got stronger by itself - it's got stronger because even low-end orgs can afford to spend big cash on player salaries or team houses or analysts or whatever. It wasn't that long ago that the NA challenger scene was a total joke, where a bunch of has-been rejects from EU (Krepo, Snoopeh, Yellowpete) were able to go to NA and get straight into LCS when they wouldn't have even been offered a starting spot on most EU challenger rosters at the time.  But now NA challenger has tons of well-funded orgs that can afford to bring in pros like Fox/Gillius, fail, then try again with Dandy/GBM. That's not something anyone in EU except Fnatic/G2/Misfits can really afford, but in NA there are 10+ teams that have that sort of financial stability.",leagueoflegends

If it's a 1v1 and the POV is spectating my opponent, if I throw a grenade and it's near the enemy, the grenade is so loud over the speakers that I can hear it and know that my grenade was close to the enemy.  You see this a lot when terrorists throw a nade on cache over boost towards whitebox, or when CTs throw the same grenade back towards boost. It's a dirty LAN trick.  Not hearing the nade isn't confirmation that the area is clear, but if you hear something then you know the spectator POV is on a person at that location.",GlobalOffensive

31337,"As someone that burned out pretty hard in Legion and am pretty much just watching the WoW subreddit for 7.3 news/8.0 speculation (where I will undoubtedly return for 8.0 and POSSIBLY just to lore out on 7.3), it's definitely not my best xpac of all time.  I'd actually rank it as follows: Wrath &gt; BC &gt; MoP &gt; Legion &gt; Cata &gt; WoD.  I have a LOT of complaints about Legion -- faux content (7.2, anyone?), raid tuning/quality (Nighthold got stale really fast after the lukewarmness that was Emerald Nightmare), difficulty of alts, over-reliance on RNG to artificially lengthen content, the mid expansion class reworks/radical balance tuning, the gutting of the classes/bland gameplay.   Legion was ALMOST a great expansion for me, but especially after (and not to shamelessly plug another game) playing another particular MMO's latest expac, Legion just doesn't compare. The writing is better, encounter design (so far) is better, class changes are better, PvP is even better. It's frustrating because Legion has WildStar syndrome for me -- it was 93% a great expansion pack but the 7% that was bad was so relentlessly bad, so unyieldingly it just killed all interest in playing for now.  That being said, I've been playing WoW since 2004, I am sure I will be playing again in 2018, and there's still a decent chance I wind up resubbing just to do the lore content (and LFR) on Argus before I AFK until 8.0.

Relevant excerpts below because judging by your ""manchildren"" horseshit, you're probably both too lazy to read it, and unwilling to read anything that might change what you already think.](https://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abpc/doc/2010/2010abpc122/2010abpc122.html?resultIndex=3)  &gt;She described herself having a sister with young children and another younger sister and brother. She told Hoffart on being questioned by him that she used to be an assistant buyer in Ontario and now she was “just finding a new place and other things”. JVV admitted that she had given the accused that answer as she did not want him to know that she was a young girl and she avoided further questions on that topic.  &gt;The accused specifically asked, (not relying on her web profile), at 7:40:31 on December 28th 2008, “Okay-I really need to ask this...How old are you?” JVV replied “y?” and the accused typed “I think I read you were 20?” to which JVV replied “Ya”- the accused “Okay - I just needed to know. If you were younger there’s no way in hel (sic) I’d be saying this :-p” and JVV replied “That’s good to know”. JVV acknowledged in cross-examination about this exchange, that she believed that if she told the accused she was fifteen she thought the conversations with him would stop and she liked them so she did what she could to keep them going.  &gt;  In perpetuation of the myth regarding her age, the complainant in her messages made reference to the fact that she was in a relationship with a man “twenty eight” and ongoing conversations with other men - “there’s three guys ‘breathing down my back’ to see me”. She made reference to cuddling up to “my beloved Mr.Bear” in the midst of a flirtatious exchange regarding her need for comfort as she was, at the same time as typing online, watching a scary movie and discussing a love poem sent to her by the accused. However, she then suggested “switching him (Mr. Bear) for the accused - a flirtatious or sexual turn on the use of the teddy bear, not a childish reference to still playing with teddy bears. She described herself as liking Tchaikovsky and listening to the Nutcracker in another exchange. The other men with whom she was conversing were described by her as being very disrespectful and sexually suggestive. She elicited considerable sympathy and indignation on her behalf from the accused, which she admitted to liking. Her discussions with him about her relationships involved a description of some that ended badly due to “being away from each other and drifting apart”. While she used type-written slang and text abbreviations and emoticons extensively, she was a poor speller. She recounted a story regarding a past relationship where “a couple of years ago I was sneaking out of my ex’s downstairs window ...”.  In another posting JVV described going out to get drunk and smoking. All of these references were consistent with her being the stated age of twenty. There were no references to parental supervision, school attendance, friendships or other young age appropriate activities, financial dependency or other youthful circumstances.  &gt;The accused asked JVV for a picture, “What do you look like?” and she appeared to have trouble posting one a number of times, then finally got a blurry one up which showed her wearing a bikini top and pants, but where her face was indistinct. A few days later he specifically asked her “what do you do anyway? I’ve never asked.” JVV did not provide that information, she just typed “nope” and “No specifics” and the accused backed off. He expressed that he was respectful of JVV’s need for privacy (in internet conversations). Eventually the accused asked to meet JVV sometime over a cup of coffee. She replied that she was very shy and then agreed but stated, “I mean we can, u know,..be together but not in this house - she would kill me”. The accused inquired, “Who’s she?”, and JVV answered “the person I’m staying with” and said “ u cant ask too many questions” - and “just to let u know, I really want to but im really nervous so ill be shy at first k?”  Before they made specific arrangements to meet, the accused gave her information in case she wanted to leave a note - “just in case”. He gave her his full name, address, phone number and vehicle description and licence plate. While the instructions for meeting were for him to pick her up at a gas station on the main road of the town, he did not think that odd as he had never been to her town and her arrangement to meet at a landmark made it easier to find her. The late hour was indicative of their mutual like of spontaneous activities. He did not think it was due to her need to sneak out. He also believed that meeting out of the house was to avoid disruption to JVV’s roommate. The complainant testified that she never knew much about the accused and particularly that she never knew his last name.  It seems like the guy actually gave a shit about making sure she was 20, and she went pretty far out of her way to keep him convinced that she was.

The rest of the time, he's been mediocre to dominant.   Out of his 19 starts, he's given up 2 ER or less in 11 of them. If you take out the dreadful starts, that's only 5 below average starts, which I could live with from a 35 year old guy.   In addition, he's posted his highest K/9 since '13. Without stats to back me up on this (just going off memory), it seems like most of his runs are given up by walking a guy or two and then letting up a homer since his BB/9 and HR/9 are all career highs.  Looking at his pitch/fx data, it looks like his success depends on the movement of his curve (surprise, surprise). His velo for his curve is also down about 5mph since his peak, but he's also losing about 1-2"" of horizontal run of his curve while his other pitches remain the same. He's also losing about 1-2"" of vert movement from his curve. In turn, this makes it less deceptive which generates more takes, which equals more walks.

""Paranoia"" on it is by far my favorite song and I recommend everyone listen to it, but really pay attention to the words. When he talks about it being summer and wanting it to rain, hating the sound of fireworks, and how everyone dies in the summer it's just depressing but he sings it so beautifully.  My whole point is, if you don't understand the music or like him... give it some time. Listen to coloring book and Acid Rap like 4-5 times before making a decision and you'll slowly find yourself loving every song.   Sorry for the book I wrote. I've just been wanting to get my Chance rant out of my system for a while now haha   Edited: paranoia was the song not nostalgia",Music

It has a greater component of initial horizontal velocity, but as soon as it leaves the gun only has one force acting upon it, straight downward, just like any object you simply drop.

I'm sorry, but you're wrong here. It is no worse for Israel to destroy these places militants use to attack civilians than for terrorists to use them to attack people. At least the Israelis bother to call the school, hospital, or home before they send a cruise missile through the front door. Terrorists don't afford that privilege to their victims.  As for the comparison to Nazi Germany, I think it is completely fair to compare cowards to cowards. As the Nazis were being pushed back they brought the injured and ill, the women and children, and the civilians out to use as human shields. Like the terrorists that fire rockets, mortars, rifles and guns into Israel the Nazis in WWII then took the stories of the Allies inadvertently killing some human shields and used that for their propaganda. They used it like the terrorists in Palestine use it to try and claim that it is not them who are doing the bad thing by using human shields but it is those trying to defend against their heinous crimes that are to blame.

21604,"The Gap is a TRIP.  Basically, Donaldson adapted Wagner's Ring Cycle into a 5-book science fiction story.  Not so basically, the point of the story is a literary game Donaldson challenged himself to accomplish: he wanted to write a story where the bad guys are just complete scum, and yet do the most amazingly noble things. And the good guys have a noble cause, but regularly do absolutely monstrous things. And the characters switch roles a lot between aggressor/victim/rescuer. Turns out these things all happen a lot in the Ring Cycle, so he used it as a template. And didn't have to pay royalties to a long-dead opera composer - cha-ching!  Astounding bit of reading.

1235,"The Wild and their goalies. A while back the Wild had a really old guy named Backstrom who recently went through stomach surgery, they had a rookie goalie in Kuemper, they picked up Bryzgalov when he finally got away from the shit show that was Philly, and they had a guy named Harding who was diagnosed with MS.  So the season ended and Bryz was in love with Minnesota. Like, Philly completely beat him down mentally and emotionally. You can go back and watch his interviews go from ""why you heff to be mad"" infectious happiness to [this](https://youtu.be/D89lN28MoGs)... so when he finally played for a team that didn't hang him out to dry and played in a city where people weren't accusing him of insane shit just to hear his accent he remembered why he loved hockey again. So the season ends and he's basically begging to go back to Minnesota and is saying in the media he will take a really cheap contract to do it. Meanwhile Darcy Kuemper is a rookie goalie who played like 17 games in the season and part of the first round of playoffs and his ELC contract was up. He basically had no career to speak of and absolutely no ground to stand on but he decided to play hardball. So instead of retaining his RFA rights and bringing Bryz back, they left Bryz out in the cold and signed Kuemper to a one way contract while they were at the bleeding edge of the salary cap. This whole sequence was baffling because they still had Harding who has a degenerative incurable disease and Backstrom who is fucking old in relation to planet Earth. So they bring back the rookie who has no guarantee on working out and they don't buyout either of the guys who are guaranteed to be on LTIR at some point.  This sounds like a recipe for failure, and it was, but holy fuck balls if you tried to say anything cautious about it. The Wild had a fierce downvote brigade that would hone in on any goalie discussion and fucking bury you for suggesting it's not a good idea to have two guys who are falling apart in your 3 headed goalie tandem. You would get your inbox bombed about what a moron you are for not understanding that, for the 8 and a half games a year when he's healthy, Harding was the second coming of Hasek. Or you're an idiot for not recognizing Kuemper is the future of the Wilds net and he will probably get his number retired by the time he leaves Minnesota. You also got the combined might of Wild fans and Philly fans talking shit to you if you suggest that maybe they should bring back the veteran goalie who is a known quantity and played well for them. Bryz was the reason the Flyers and the Wild both failed to win the Cup as far as anyone was concerned. Fuck his decent stats and solid play. The only place anyone would budge was admitting the stitched together Frankenstein corpse of Backstrom was probably done at the end of the year but nobody would admit he needed to be off the roster.   All in all it was a super shitty time and is the sole reason I hate Wild fans and give zero fucks about their team ever experiencing success. ",hockey

So they will attack high garden for supplies. Then possibly deal with dorne somehow. Then there will be 4 major sides. Danny, lanisters, the north, and the walkers.    The north is too preoccupied with the walkers to do anything against cersi so really the lanisters only have to fight danny and if they do so after defeating high garden and dorne then it should be a decent fight considering they will be well supplied and rich off loot.    I have full confidence that the lanisters will attack high garden and win. It would be bad story telling for the lanister army to be defeated by attrition and lack of morale. Considering cersi and Jamie both mention needing a victory to boost morale and allies, and also supplies that high garden has. It just seems like a certainty.    Danny didnt bring 3 dragons, the unsullied, and a horde all the way across the ocean to defeat a shadow of what the lanisters army used to be. No. They will become stronger than ever and itll be a big battle.    My guess is that with the victory in high garden the lanisters might also gain some allies considering Jamie mentions that too.

37104,"An no it is not an ad hominem attack to ask if you have read up on the way the system is designed.  we built our system so there is not a tyranny of the majority.  The whole Point of electoral system was a compromise between large and small states.  The system was designed so a candidate cannot just get the large states and call it a wrap.  Rural states that provided a lot of food and resources needed equal representation when compared to large urban locations.  Each group face a different set of challenges and have different solutions.  Without this design all you have to do is win Texas California and New York.  there really is no other reason to hit the other states.  So when I said group think I was referring to getting a few major population centers.  We have state caucuses to flush out the candidates and evolve the conversation. That is the purpose of the debates, to refine conversations.  The question the USA needs to ask is why is there a separation from the coasts and Central America?    And if our country was such a laughing stock why are we having a conversation about building walls to keep other people out.  Historically walls were built to keep people in.

30965,"&gt; which of the sub-series is the best to get into first?  ######Best:  1. [Fate/Stay Night](https://vndb.org/v11) Visual Novel.   /r/fatestaynight has a guide for installing it iirc.   Alternatively, you can read a text-based low-commentary lets play on [lparchive](http://lparchive.org/Fatestay-night/) (Just ignore any cursive text not starting with ""Music:"").  After this, you can watch any Stay Night anime if you want. This includes [DEEN's anime](https://myanimelist.net/anime/356/Fate_stay_night?q=stay%20n), [Ufotable's UBW anime](https://myanimelist.net/anime/27821/Fate_stay_night__Unlimited_Blade_Works_-_Prologue), and [Ufotable's upcoming HF movies](https://myanimelist.net/anime/25537/Fate_stay_night_Movie__Heavens_Feel?q=heaven%27s%20fee). As you have already experienced these in the VN, the order isn't really important, and if you don't like one, you can drop it without worry.  2\. [Fate/Zero](https://myanimelist.net/anime/10087/Fate_Zero)   ######Anime-only 1:  1. [Fate/Zero](https://myanimelist.net/anime/10087/Fate_Zero)   Prequel to Fate/Stay Night. If you don't like the first season, hold out until the second. The first season is rather slow in comparison to the second.  2. [Fate/Stay Night DEEN](https://myanimelist.net/anime/356/Fate_stay_night?q=stay%20n) ???   You can leave this one out if you don't like it. It's the adaption of the Fate route, which set the fundamentals for what's to come in the other two routes. Though I don't remember whether that's true for the anime as well.    3. [Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works (Ufotable)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/27821/Fate_stay_night__Unlimited_Blade_Works_-_Prologue)   If you don't like the first season, hold out until the second. Just like Fate/Zero, the first season is rather slow in comparison to the second.  4. [Fate/Stay Night: Heaven's Feel](https://myanimelist.net/anime/25537/Fate_stay_night_Movie__Heavens_Feel?q=heaven%27s%20fe) (not yet released)  - ######Anime-only 2:  2.

[Fate/Zero](https://myanimelist.net/anime/10087/Fate_Zero)    ---  People usually recommend the second anime-only order over the first, but I don't think it's really that important. I'd say, it depends on which kind of anime you prefer. Zero is more mature with professional characters who know what they are doing, but also constant switching between the characters, while Stay Night is the school anime with the morally white highschool protagonist who is a noob at magic and just stumbles into the battle royale.    If you want to go with the order that's usually recommended (the second), make sure you're ready to wait with Zero until the HF movies have been fully released (or read that part of the VN).   **DO NOT INSERT FATE/ZERO INBETWEEN TWO STAY NIGHT ROUTES.**  ------ ------ ------  Further Fate stuff:  ------  * Example  (Medium) [Dependencies]  - * [Fate/Hollow Ataraxia](https://vndb.org/v50) (Visual Novel) [F/SN]  * [Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya](https://myanimelist.net/anime/14829/Fate_kaleid_liner_Prisma%E2%98%86Illya?q=kaleid) (Manga, Anime) [F/SN, F/HA]  * [Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya 2wei](https://myanimelist.net/anime/20509/Fate_kaleid_liner_Prisma%E2%98%86Illya_2wei) (Manga, anime) [F/SN, F/HA]  * [Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya 2wei Herz](https://myanimelist.net/anime/27525/Fate_kaleid_liner_Prisma%E2%98%86Illya_2wei_Herz) (Anime) [F/SN, F/HA]  * [Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya 3rei](https://myanimelist.net/manga/36131/Fate_kaleid_liner_Prisma%E2%98%86Illya_3rei) (Manga) [F/SN, F/HA, Notes., F/Z, F/Proto]  * [Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya 3rei](https://myanimelist.net/anime/31706/Fate_kaleid_liner_Prisma%E2%98%86Illya_3rei) (Anime) [F/SN, F/HA, Notes.]  * [Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya: Sekka no Chikai](https://myanimelist.net/anime/34100/Fate_kaleid_liner_Prisma%E2%98%86Illya_Movie) (Upcoming Movie) [F/SN, F/Z, F/Proto]  * [Fate/Extra](https://vndb.org/v7602) (PSP game/Manga) [F/SN]  * [Fate/Extra CCC](https://vndb.org/v12369) (PSP game/Manga) [F/SN]  * [Fate/Extra: Last Encore](https://myanimelist.net/anime/33047/Fate_Extra_Last_Encore) (Upcoming Anime) [F/SN, F/E]  * [Fate/Grand Order](http://fategrandorder.wikia.com/wiki/Fate/Grand_Order_Wikia) (Mobile Game) [All Fate-related stuff]  * [Fate/Extella](https://vndb.org/v19119) (PSVita/PS4 Game) [F/E, F/SN, F/GO]  * [Fate/Strange Fake](https://myanimelist.net/manga/83903/Fate_strange_Fake?q=strange%20fake) (Manga/Light Novel) [F/SN]  * [Fate/Apocrypha](https://myanimelist.net/manga/33005/Fate_Apocrypha?q=apocrypha) (Light Novel/Manga) [-]  * [Fate/Unlimited Codes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateUnlimitedCodes) (PS2 Game) [F/SN]  * [Fate/Prototype OVA](https://myanimelist.net/anime/12565/Fate_Prototype) (OVA) [-]  * [Fate/Prototype: Fragments of Blue and Silver](https://myanimelist.net/manga/61005/Fate_Prototype__Sougin_no_Fragments?q=prototype) (Light Novel) [F/P]  * [Garden of Avalon](https://myanimelist.net/manga/85773/Fate_stay_night__Garden_of_Avalon?q=garden%20of%20avalon) (Light Novel) [F/SN]  * [Lord El-Melloi II Case Files](https://myanimelist.net/manga/85437/Lord_El-Melloi_II-sei_no_Jikenbo?q=lord%20el-mello) (Light Novel) [F/SN, F/HA]  * [Carnival Phantasm](https://myanimelist.net/anime/10012/Carnival_Phantasm?q=carnival) (Anime) [F/SN, F/HA, F/E, Tsukihime, Melty Blood?]  * [Fate/Grand Order: First Order](https://myanimelist.net/anime/34321/Fate_Grand_Order__First_Order) (OVA) [F/SN]  * [Fate/Labyrinth](https://myanimelist.net/manga/88347/Fate_Labyrinth) (Manga) [F/SN, Fate/Proto: Fragments]  * [Fate/Grand Order Fuyuki one-shot](https://imgur.com/a/1B2aE#QnPKlN0) (Manga) [FSN]  * [Fate/Empire of Dirt](https://twitter.com/maple_LuwenWS) (Upcoming Fanmade RPG) [F/GO]  * [Learn with Manga!

2922,"&gt; Although the Constitution of the United States does not cite it explicitly, presumption of innocence is widely held to follow from the 5th, 6th, and 14th amendments. The case of Coffin v. United States (1895) established the presumption of innocence of persons accused of crimes.  Most modern democracies also have presumption of innocence directly written in their constitutions.  &gt; The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 11, states: ""Everyone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial at which he has had all the guarantees necessary for his defence.""  All of this taken from Wikipedia with a quick google search.  Your second comment (courts declaring people ""not guilty"" instead of ""innocent"") has nothing to do with your first comment. Presumption of innocence is a real thing, codified in many constitutions around the world, and indirectly pulled from the 5th, 6th and 14th amendment of the US constitution.  Basically, you are *presumed* innocent until proven guilty. That doesn't mean a crime didn't happen.  Civil litigation goes through the same process, it doesn't just immediately happen and the accused party is somehow now found guilty. Even in civil litigation the accused party is still innocent until a judge makes his or her decision based on the facts and evidence presented to him or her.  The NFL is a private organization with their own rules and codes of conduct. Smoking marijuana is legal in California, yet any player for the chargers, rams, raiders, or niners can be suspended for violating the leagues policy against drugs. Because, again, the NFL has its own rules and can apply them how the organization sees fit. So using the NFL as an example doesn't work in this argument.",nfl

He first gained world-wide recognition as the writing talent behind the popular American folk-rock duo Simon &amp; Garfunkel formed with fellow musician Art Garfunkel. When Simon &amp; Garfunkel split in 1970, Simon quickly began his solo career with the release of the self-titled album, Paul Simon. This was followed by There Goes Rhymin' Simon and Still Crazy After All These Years, both of which featured chart-topping hits such as Loves Me Like A Rock and Kodachrome. In 1986 Simon released the immensely popular Graceland, which featured the groundbreaking use of African rhythms and performers Ladysmith Black Mambazo. In 1990, he followed up Graceland with the successor album The Rhythm of the Saints which featured Brazilian and Cajun musical themes. These albums helped to popularize world music as a genre.  &gt; He co-wrote the unsuccessful, but critically-acclaimed musical The Capeman with Nobel-winning poet Derek Walcott in 1997.   &gt; Paul Simon still tours occasionally, both as a solo artist and with his old musical partner Art Garfunkel. He is married to Edie Brickell.   &gt; In 1994 Paul Simon held 14 sold out concerts in Nantes (France) with International professional fusion players: Nino Manore (Italy), Francis Mc Gowan (UK), Gissele Masarde (France), Nikša Sviličić (Croatia), and others.

The beauty of this approach is that they can put more work into 2 ""halls"", making them evolve visually when you reach certain milestones or something.

38091,"You forgot to mention Adam Morrison...   in all seriousness, I personally was calling those Lakers teams ""stacked"" back in 2009/10 - so it is not revisionist history. That buzzword gets thrown around way too much.  LO was an absolute matchup nightmare for opposing teams that would go on to be a 6MOTY award winner not long after that year. Gasol was the A1 sidekick Kobe needed to put him over the top, he was an All-NBA player and a bonafide superstar.   Bynum was probably the best young center in the league at the time (aside from Apex Dwight Howard) and combined with LO and Gasol gave the Lakers some stupid length that teams just couldn't fuck with at the time. He was oft injured but when healthy he was an X-Factor.  They weren't ""stacked"" by today's superteam (GSW/Heatles) standards, but at the time? They were stacked. The best (or 2nd best, depending on personal opinion) player in the world + All-NBA player + 6MOTY forward + Bynum was a very, very good team.   Analysts are wrong about many things, I would posit that the back-to-back champion Lakers teams having the worst supporting cast in recent history falls into that ""they were wrong"" category. When the Gasol-for-Gasol swap happened, many many people (myself included) felt that the Grizzlies just gave the Lakers at least one championship ring - and were right. ",nba

The EU is a creature of law.  You don't get to just 'view' law into being.  There is considerable legal agreement that the UK is actually under no legal obligation (for the full bill) post-Brexit and it is ridiculous to treat it as if it has broken legal commitments when it has not (the EU's own lawyers have admitted that most of what appears in the bill is not legally enforceable: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/06/100bn-brexit-bill-legally-impossible-enforce-european-commissions/).

3575,"&gt; the motivations do matter especially when one of the motivations means Trump possibly trying to cripple renewables in favour of coal.  But you're just guessing at his motivations. Yeah he wants to up the coal industry. It's jobs. Not as many as solar but we're also not going to train 55 year old people from the coal industry to suddenly work in solar when they're retiring in 5 years anyway. It's not practical.  The two aren't mutually exclusive though. I can support coal jobs. I can support NOT wanting to send money to 3rd world countries for renewables. They don't have to be related. Again, you're just guessing like I am.  &gt;but with the current U.S government there is a very good chance it won't be spent on that.  True, I'd argue. But the US government doesn't have to.

Add in the fact that Trump Jr. never would have released this email if it shows what all the armchair lawyers are claiming it shows. His lawyers _never_ would have cleared that.   I just can't be fucked to care. What we have is Goldstone saying she worked for the Russian government, and she's saying she doesn't. A literal he said, she said. Far too many people are believing Goldstone at face value, rather than questioning the whole story (which is what we should be doing).   I'll gladly eat crow if it comes out what he did was illegal. I just don't see that scenario playing out, no matter how much people are wishing it to. ",conspiracy

39380,"I'm very happy to address your concerns and don't take it as offensive, believe me I relish every opportunity I get to explain these things :)  The verses you bring up are not commandments Muslims are given that they must carry out, they are in fact re-tellings of historical events (at least that's how they can be viewed in a modern context).  Basically think of it this way, some parts of the Quran were unveiled to directly guide the Muslims during the days of the Prophet. So for example 9:29 as you bring up happened during a tense treaty between the Muslims and non-Muslims and in fact there was on going fighting and such. These verses were basically commands to the people it was revealed to at the time.  I do agree with you that the Muslims who advocate violence use these verses to justify the violence. However they very much deliberately go against the actual meanings of the verses. It's like opening up a novel, reading one line from one page and deciding what the entire story is about based on that one line.  These verses can only really be invoked in proper context, and last time I checked norway was not executing, torturing or in any real way oppressing Muslims which given the context in which tehse verses are writte makes them irrelevant.  It's a bit hard to explain in depth (and I'm probably not qualified to do so either), but there's some great reading material you can check out to actaully understand where I'm coming from. [Try here](http://www.theamericanmuslim.org/tam.php/features/articles/quran_929_commentary/) for just one example :)  So to summarize, you are right, they take the verses very literally but they also ignore the contexts in which they are made entirely, going so far as to take one verse out of a story and claiming it's a commandment upon all Muslims.",worldnews

That said:  &gt;She already got two buffs in a row that left people wondering what the hell she got them for since she was already fine, and you want a third one?  So it is a very tiny buff that is basically a quality of life improvement nothing more. She is fine as in ""not trash"". Orianna and syndra and multiple other champs literally do everything lux does 10 times better and are less reliant on your team not feeding and do not need everything to work out perfectly. They also have way more going for them. Both can dish out more damage in a fight especially more consistent damage because if you miss one q it only has a few second cooldown anyways so it's not a huge deal. If lux misses her skills in a fight it basically makes her useless due to her high cooldowns. You need to have everything work out perfectly to do the same shit that an orianna or syndra can do while missing half your stuff. There is a reason lux is a rare sight above gold elo and basically never seen above diamond 5.    &gt;No, they can't. They use their main source of damage, while Lux keeps her binding and ultimate, and they still need to use 2-3 skills to clear a wave. With what I said above, they definitely don't use less mana when they're using 2-3 skills.  Yes they absolutely can. Syndra with her first back around level 5 with lost chapter can twoshot caster minions with her q. Go try it out in practice tool. With 100 ap around level 9 (so midgame) she can oneshot them. Lux with lost chapter at level 5 leaves caster minions at half hp with one e so you need to all auto them once. At the same ap as syndra at level 9 at the same time she leaves the caster minions at this super annoying 5 hp status that i talked about in my post. You will never have to use more than 2 qs with syndra or ziggs to kill casters. And even when you use 2 q's they still cost less mana and are faster than lux e. As soon as you get a decent amount of ap with syndra or ziggs you will always oneshot the caster minions with a q. With lux this often is not the case even when you already have morellos. Also you say they use their main source of damage while lux doesn't. Syndra and ziggs both use only q, both have very short cd. They both still have w, e and ult which all do a lot of damage. Lux is left with q (which doesn't do a lot of damage early on and his really high cd) and ult which is difficult to hit without q.    &gt;Not exclusive to Lux, so why should she get something because when literally every other champion in the game, according to you, shouldn't?  I didn't necessarily say no other champ should get this treatment but i am not aware of any where it is this annoying. At least not the ones that fill the same role as her.   &gt;Oh yeah, let's give a third undeserved buff to a champion that's already between fine and strong. As I mentioned before, people were already wondering why she got a needless buff, much less a second. Both buffs ended up being assumed by many to be to jack up Elementalist Lux sales.  I am not really gonna repeat myself here. Lux is outclassed in her role by several other champs that do everything she does better. That is fact. A small buff like this would not be unjustified nor would it break her balancing. ",leagueoflegends

A lot more people nowadays realize that the system as it is now isn't worth protecting; that it needs to evolve and improve. They look at Bond not as a protector but as an impeder of progress.  My wish is that they either go back to the more campy style or change Bond into someone working against the system in the name of political progress and in doing so treading into some morally gray areas.

But there is are two problems:  1. There is a very vocal and active minority against soldiers. 2. While most soldiers understand that the majority in Germany gives a shit about the military. The effect is that the only feedback soldiers get is negative. Let it be in experiences in public or from the press. The press will not report on the military unless it is negative (which is understandable) but then also show a complete lack of understanding on military matters.  To make it clear: As a German soldier you can expect the following things:  1. Be insulted in public. 2. Have the press only talk about your profession when they have a complaint. 3. Have no support from politics. 4. Have no public support whatsoever.  That does not help to fight people who dream from times when German soldiers were respected.",europe

For all you know it is just a placebo response to make you feel good about it.  The ""proper action"" could have been absolutely nothing at all.  The potential for ill has to do with the chance that a troll reports a legitimate player and due to the inevitable occurence of human error manages to inflict a punishment on them.  Reporting a success (or perhaps even just a potential success as is the case in LoL) becomes a positive feedback loop that encourages the troll to increase his volume of attacks.  As trolls collectively increase their volume of attacks, the likelihood of false positives goes up even more.  Bottom line, a solid reporting system may stop the weakest of trolls out there, but committed trolls are always going to find ways around the system and potentially even subvert it to their own devices, and the ones left to bear the burden of such a system are erroneously punished legitimate players.

33426,"""Just talk to them"" is dumb advice.  I mean obviously, you should just talk to them, but it's not that easy. What's needed here is advice on how to get the courage to just talk to them without being excruciatingly awkward. For this, I offer the following;  Play a game in your head. You are a skilled and experienced secret agent, on a mission disguised as an ordinary person. Expertly applied make-up makes you look like an average individual instead of the mind-shatteringly attractive deity you saw in your mirror this morning just after getting out of bed. The person you want, no, *need* to talk to is your mark. You don't know anything about them, except that this morning an anonymous man on the street slipped you an envelope sealed with the official HQ cryptographic seal, containing a photo of your mark, and instructions to find out what you can about them, without them suspecting. HQ wants to know where they're from, what kind of work they do, what they do for fun, their opinions about some things that are in the news, and whatever else you can glean. Any detail about these things may be useful, so don't worry about why HQ wants the information, that's not your job.  So this is a person you *have to* talk to, because it's a matter of national security. You aren't interested in them, and it doesn't matter if they aren't interested in you (but if you can get them to be, that might be useful). You're just having a casual friendly conversation, you don't want them to suspect anything, but whenever there's a reasonable opportunity, you ask a question about them and try to get them talking about themselves. You have to pay close attention because you're going to need to compile a report from memory, and you might hear things that can open up new questions. If you are asked about yourself, talk about your cover story (real life). Keep it plausible and interesting, to make sure they want to stay in the conversation, but don't go on too long, since it's not advancing your mission.  Fun fact: Fake confidence works just as well as the real stuff, and has half the calories. After a little while you may find that the secret agent thing isn't necessary any more, and you're just having an engaging conversation with the person.",AskReddit

68366,"&gt; I'm saying that he's more likely to increase more in usage and make incremental increases to his ppg than to just balloon to 30 points a game, at his current rate.  I mentioned 25ppg next season, but I'd expect him to stay around there for at least a couple years.  &gt; But the goal should be to become more efficient, as to not waste possessions. Out of every player who's ever averaged 30+ points and averaged 5 assists, a field goal percentage of .423 (which he has now) would be the second worst of all time, sandwiched in between two A.I seasons. Are you honestly telling me you would rather have someone average 30 on bad efficiency than say, 26-27 on great efficiency?  I think the biggest factor is age and team situation here. Suns are a young developing team and with the addition of Jackson to help facilitate, I think Booker is in a great position for the future. Odds tend to favor a player improving efficiency overtime rather than declining (until the drop off after prime). Supporting cast plays a role as well. Of course, I'd hope he'd have better than .423 by the time he's close to averaging 30~ ppg and I think doing it on around .44-.45 would be reasonable. I mean I understand the point you're trying to make, but I imagine if we took the FG% of a few historically great scorers from their first or second year and eventually had 30~ ppg seasons, they'd rank pretty low too. There are also very few players who eventually averaged 30 ppg (or close to it) that already averaged 22 ppg in their second year. He's up there with names like Iverson, Jordan, Malone, Wade, etc. in THIS regard.",nba

When you have an MVP join a 73-9 team that probably should've won the Finals in 2016, you basically leave other teams with no chance to compete. Before Durant's decision, there were four legitimate contenders: Golden State, Cleveland, San Antonio, and Oklahoma City. By joining the best regular season team in NBA history, KD basically guaranteed only one contender. KD is not the best player in the league, but he is the best scorer and a close second to LeBron.

Todd Gurley didn't do anything to help himself though. His [stats on FO](http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/rb) have him as the 37th ranked RB last season. Compare that to [2010 Jamaal Charles](http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/rb2010) who remember also had the 29th ranked Oline in the NFL.... yet JC finished 1st in DVOA.   Simple fact is yeah the Rams Oline is trash but Gurley was also trash last season and didn't do a damn thing to help. This sums it up  &gt;In the entire history of the NFL, there are 320 instances of a running back accumulating at least 275 carries in a single season.

Take the various Islamic extremist factions to have cropped up in the last 15-20 years. Most of them, if they could get away with it, would have absolutely no problem whatsoever with bringing their backwards thinking to Canada. Were it not for the fact we are extremely fucking lucky insofar as geography goes, they'd have very likely tried by now (see also: Europe). That same backwards thinking sees things like the charter as entirely incompatible, and would set it on fire if that was all it would take to render it useless.  We are never going to be directly in the line of fire just on basic principle, given our geographic location and the fact if anyone wanted to aim at North America they'd likely aim at the US. But we value the exact same rights, more or less, as places like the UK. Much in the same way that we shouldn't be okay with rights being violated in Canada, we should be equally not okay with rights being violated in allied countries, or countries under our protection. Unfortunately, that's going to mean getting our hands dirty.  The long and short of it is they're called *international* human rights for a reason. The charter is just Canada's attempt at carrying out those rights--which is how free speech laws in Canada become significantly different from those in the US, despite both countries having the right to free speech.  TL, DR: No international human rights, no charter. No enforcement, no international human rights.

47832,"Well we can do the math if you want. Just need the distance travelled, divided by 3/4 the range capable on a full charge. The remaining number should be the amount of times you need to recharge. If each location recharged at charges at the pace of an hour for a full charge from 1/4 charge, then the math is rather simple at that point.   I imagine without running the numbers that you are probably going to have to recharge about 3 to 5 times max depending on the route, the traffic conditions and the actual range of your vehicle. So your 18 hour trip might rise to something like a 23 hour trip to be frank, but is that really so bad?

42465,"&gt; I wouldn't be so quick to blame people for initially voting for the AKP.  They (this is common) are blaming a specific set of people though, not 'the people' at large.  Besides initially AKP only got 33% but an overwhelming majority in the parliament.  &gt; The nationalistic Kemalist 'social democracy' of the CHP and the Turkish establishment was a very authoritarian and overbearing regime for many pious Turks.  CHP wasn't even in the parliament in 2002 -- they were below the threshold.    The so-called po-mo coup of '97 did hurt a lot of pious people but I doubt it was enough to sway elections.  The reasons to support AKP in the first term would be things like completing the privatizations (the big one, the national telco hadn't been privatized yet), continuing with the EU harmonization packages, fiscal discipline etc.  We had an unpopular program implemented after the economic crisis of 2001 and AKP was uniquely positioned to implement it because it would pacify the people who'd have screamed otherwise and they had to do it because that was the only avenue open to them (the establishment would have taken them down otherwise, as they tried in various ways).   This was the calculation: they'd finish destroying the power of entrenched interests with the economic transformation plans; subdue the pious masses who could, if in opposition, be mobilized against the new policies; continue on the set path to securing Turkish candidacy for accession to EU while pulling their loud anti-West base to positions compatible with it etc.  The flaw in the intellectuals' support was not about supporting AKP, the flaw was telling people that they were either 'liberals' or were 'liberalizing' out of their own ideological bent.  That latter bit discredited both those intellectuals and more or less finished off the label 'liberal.'    &gt;  In this case, if Kemalism didn't have so many shortcomings, the program of the AKP - which initially seemed very progressive, like overhauling the healthcare system and making it modern and universal - would not have appealed to large swaths of the Turkish population.  I don't even know what Kemalism is or was as of 2002.  The social security reform did happen alongside many others, yes.  I used to joke that, with some modifications, what they did would have had some other party pegged as 'red' _by their own base_ just a decade or so ago.  I posted a short summary about the 'left'-ish thing they did [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Turkey/comments/1dhq1o/akp_government_and_the_future_of_chp_voters_in/c9qjmgq/). ",europe

Facing a penalty for linking is like facing a penalty for tattling on someone. Whether you were ratting them out for their benefit or against their wishes, you've raised awareness of their actions. If this encourages people to join in on those actions, you cannot be blamed as a conspirator or an accomplice unless your connection is more than just raising awareness.

All goes well and we clear mythic EN. When Nighthold mythic started our two raid leaders decide to take a break from the game. We still had about 4 other officers but none of them were really capable of leading a 20 man team. So we stick a bit to heroic raiding.  I create a website for them, then start making spreadsheets for tracking our performance per member, host a team speak server, which eventually went to Discord because its way better. Set up the complete Discord server. So after a while they ask my IRL friend and me to become officer and lead our team to some mythic kills again.  So we eventually get to 7/10 mythic, to our lovely strarbro.   Then out of the blue my IRL friend starts spreading rumours about me wanting to realm transfer because our guild would never be able to 10/10 Night hold. In 1 night the guild owner demotes me to social. I try to get an explanation for what is happening but I don't get any answers and I should just deal with it. I left the guild the next day. It felt like all of the work I had done was destroyed over one night.   Multiple other guild members also left because they didn't see any future in the guild anymore without me raidleading. Our main tank and 1 healer left, crippling the mythic team. I'm actually kind of happy they haven't cleared ToS heroic yet.  Done venting :(",wow

2101,"&gt; But, it's kind of obvious why, isn't it? It's objectively not the same thing.  There are several types of FGM. The types most people immediately think of are as you describe - objectively different from male circumcision, and much worse.  There are other types that aren't different, and aren't worse, though. There's one sort that's removal of the clitoral hood only, which is exactly analogous to removal of the foreskin.  There are other types of FGM that are actually far less drastic than male circumcision. One, for example, involves a ""ceremonial pinprick"" or ""ceremonial scrape"" where a very small poke or scratch is done just to draw a drop of blood.  Nevertheless, people lump all FGM together under ""FGM"", and bans on the practice prohibit all sorts.  There are two ways to make things fair. Either we specifically prohibit the ""bad FGM"" and allow the ""less bad FGM"", or we extend the same sort of outrage and legislation to male circumcision as we already have for *all* FGM (both the severe types and the less severe ones).  I'm in favour of expanding our opposition to these terrible cultural practices.",canada

I can say that OW is not the most toxic community out there, it's just less regulated.   I don't think you're idea of a scoreboard isn't that bad, but it's the way it's implemented that would matter. If they did it as a post-game only thing I believe that would help a lot with self evaluation.   In game? No. The competitive queue is closer to quick play than any tournament scene. You don't have a set team that you have chemistry with, and that's a big factor. Everyone is more inclined to flame a random person, but less inclined to flame a friend. There's also generally some respect for your opponents in a tournament, where they're is none on the ladder.

Not to mention that I have megalophobia, which is a phobia for large objects. In my case, I never feel it IRL, but only looking at images or in games does it appear, especially when it's giant empty structures in flat plains or open spaces, which Karazhan kinda checks out pretty well.

Even without competition there will always be disparity created by natural physical differences. Disparity is simply a difference between outcomes.  Try as I might I will never run as fast as Usain Bolt. I could have started training at birth and trained harder and more frequently than he has. There are physiological differences one of them being a small but substantial difference in the size, shape, and I believe fiber consistency of our gluteus muscles that will make it so I can never be his equal. If we each ran a mile he'd win by a long shot and even if we weren't competing those numbers would exist and they would create a disparity. Differences and their resulting disparity will create classes of people.  What you are talking for is equity or the equality of outcome. Where we must handicap the exceptional among us to create parity with masses. This is collectivist, taking away from the individual to give to the collective.  What I push for is equality or the equality of opportunity, egalitarianism and meritocracy. This is individualism, to each their own.    Under the definition of left and right that I gave, that would make equity the left side of the equation and equality the right side of the equation and the center would be neither equity nor equality, but any mix in between.  The beauty of the definition I am using is that you can apply it to any issue individually with the same level of consistency that it is applied to the greater context of the three primary axis of Governance, Economics, and Social Policy.    If you think of everything in politics in terms of taking authority from individuals and giving it to a collective you can more easily define positions and place yourself along the axis.    And what makes my definition the most correct? Besides the logical consistency, transparency, and easy of use? It does not making any judgements on the morality of either side and it leaves the judgement up to each person deciding their place on the spectrum.   As opposed to all of the definitions that have been spouted in this thread that boil down to nothing more than ""everything I support is left and everything evil in the world is right."" Which is the most absurd, egotistical, self-righteous, self-centered, and lazy method of addressing political discourse imaginable.  It can create some uncomfortable realizations for those that cling to claims of moral superiority as the defining part of their political identity; but only in places where there was already a massive amount of cognitive dissonance in the first place.",worldnews

Nobody on my team should be trying to decide for me who I should play based on history.   On a side note, I think it would be interesting if there were a system where you can select your ""current main(s) "" and it pairs you up with complementary teammates. Then, everyone gets to play what they want with a balanced comp.   The thing that killed this game for me was the constant in-fighting. It's almost like road rage. People can't help themselves.   And a big part of that rage might be because this is a game of counters, rather than teamwork. If everyone chose  1 character on the enemy team to counter, that team will win. But that's now how it should work. A good team build should be able to stand on its own against anything. And every combination of teams needs to be able to stand up on its own against anything.  Basically, when every possible combination is perfectly balanced, people will stop raging. But that's not how this game works. So people will rage on because their teamate won't pick an obvious counter and the rager can't change.    People rage in this game more than I've ever had in any game. The game itself kind of is responsible, because the balancing is frustrating. ",Overwatch

I squelched their chat and everything but 3 people spamming hello non stop made me tilt like no other and I got off. I genuinely couldn't think because D.Va and Mercy and Genji's voicelines were ringing in my ears.   I wish leaving comms and focusing on your own play could have an impact in the game, but it reduces your chance of winning pretty severely IMO.   In Dota, you know when a teamfight is coming. It's very clear and it's very important that everyone participates. There's no chance that one of your teammates just wont go to it and use everything they have. Well, there is a chance, but it's much less than in OW where you don't know if your team wants to fight or not.   In Overwatch, if you're not in comms and you engage in a teamfight with your team and they don't follow up and they back out, it's **your fault.** Not theirs for not using ults. This now means you'll probably be at a big disadvantage for at least a minute and a half.  There's also a severe lack of comeback mechanics. In Dota, you can lose the entire game but win in the last 15 minutes, easily. In OW, it's pretty clear to see how everything will pan out after the first 10 minutes.",Overwatch

1323,"They are not entirely distinct. It comes down to supply and demand. Jobs are available in every field, but women don't pursue a certain portion of them. Therefore this leaves many women competing for the same position at a company, but that company wants a balance of men and women because hiring all women would be discrimination. Therefore there is a surplus of female applicants, aka supply is high and demand is low. Whatever woman they hire just takes the job, without considering she can get paid more to get her hands dirty elsewhere. And if she puts her foot down and demands a raise, she can be easily replaced by another woman who has also been avoiding dangerous jobs. White collar companies need to do more to hold onto their male employees, because there are less of them pursuing that particular line of work.  Note that I am not an advocate of this behavior, I'm just giving a possible explanation for the situation, and pointing out that it's not just men that need to change their way of thinking.",worldnews

23480,"&gt; I gave a **potential reason** why it might not matter, I didn't **assume** anything.  [Euphemism](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/euphemism)  Here's another word you might be interested in looking up ""Hypocrisy""  &gt;Really? Quoting me out of context?  It's called using your opponents words against his. And it's always a good tactic to throw someone off balance.  &gt;Who gets to decide this standard? You? You don't even like the genre, Why would we let someone who doesn't like the genre decide industry standards?  And neither are you by calling calling my based complains ""petty"". You're not calling the shots either by setting the bar or in your case lowering the bar and make all this BS believable to the point of falsely calling it ""realistic"". But so far in this thread, you're the only one calling this BS realistic when others aknowledge the BS and still like it.  &gt;1) Not assumptions, you're misusing that word repeatedly   Grab a dictionary buddy. Assumptions: Noun. a thing that is accepted as true or as certain **to happen**, **without proof**.  Sounds a lot what you've been doing by telling us the MC might not even have a family or friends to mourn him over.  &gt;2) Your complaint was that someone who had died wasn't interested in anything else other than what was going on while he was drinking tea with literal fucking God, I gave you a perfectly possible explanation as to why he isn't concerned with those things. Assuming would be saying he is an otaku and they don't give a shit about anyone but that would actually be assuming. Regardless he straight up went to ask after requesting the phone if he would be able to use it properly to which God answered in the negative   My complain was that his story or the lack of is totally unbeliveable.  If he lives alone, he must have a job to sustain himself. If he has a job, then at least his employeer will miss him when he died.   How is it possible he feels no attachment to his past life, but suddenly feels the need to save two complete strangers when he couldn't give himself a second to think of those he left behind in the first place? It's totally absurd.  &gt;Just like you're looking for a reason to dumpster on it  I don't need a reason.

On the other hand you're the only one in this thread calling all this BS realistic.  &gt;You know nothing either, That's the point of discussion and coming up with potential answers until more information is given   And most of the time an actual beliveable explanations to all this horsehit won't come up anyway, so why wait? I got as much right to question all this BS than you have to ""assume"" oh my bad, give ""potential reason"". The difference is that you have no hardcore proof to stand on.   &gt;Giving a token ""It's trash and I'm trash for liking it"" is not very **honest**, It's avoiding judgment on perceived taste  I never said you had to call yourself trash for liking something. But admiting you like something that it's publically ignored or frown upon talks about honesty. Unlike to what you're doing.  &gt;Oh I don't disagree it has flaws, But I'm not going to sit there and let you dumpster on a show thats enjoyable with petty complaints   And I have pretty much the same rights to question all these farfetched events you so call ""realistic"" ",anime

Because there are people who calculate the statistically likelihood of car accidents based on demographic and, believe it or not, men are more likely to get into the big accidents. Is it fair that women might be favored for a job? Don't get me started on that debate because its the same debate as any regarding affirmative action. There are a lot of arguments about why it is or isn't fair.   I really don't understand what your paragraph about fairness has to do with my comment, but things aren't fair, and that doesn't mean we shouldn't strive to be fair. ",funny

They formed in the summer of 1993 after Palumbo and Beck met each other at camp.  They recorded some demos before releasing the EP ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" in 1997, and recorded their first full length album ""Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Silence"" in 2000 on Roadrunner Records.  The record brought the band out of Long Island and into the hands of a dedicated grass-roots following. The band has been influential in the progression of the underground music scene in the eastern United States and United Kingdom and on the post-hardcore genre, and are known for their intense live shows and constant line-up changes.  &gt; Their sophomore album ""Worship and Tribute"" was released in 2002 on Warner Brothers Records.   Although it received some MTV airtime, a Grammy nomination and a peak at #82 on the Billboard top 200, ""Worship and Tribute"" was a departure from the debut and was met with mixed reviews from fans.  Since then, Glassjaw have not recorded any new material, releasing the digital-only EP ""El Mark"" in 2005, a release that consisted of three unused songs from the ""Worship and Tribute"" sessions.  &gt; In 2005, all members spare Palumbo and Beck left the band for reasons which remain unclear.  It is supposed that they left involuntarily.  Ex-drummer Durijah Lang and ex-bass player Manuel Ragoonanan Carrero were soon inducted back into the band, so there was once again a functional lineup for playing shows.  Indeed, the new four-piece Glassjaw played a handful of shows in Summer 2005.  A new album was apparently in the works for a release in 2007, but never surfaced.  &gt; Daryl Palumbo also fronts electronic pop-rock band Head Automatica, and ex-Glassjaw drummer Larry Gorman also played for them; however, Gorman is no longer a member of the band for unknown reasons.  &gt; Ex-guitarist Todd Weinstock now plays in the similarly-styled band Men, Women, &amp; Children.  &gt; After a two-year hiatus, the band played three shows in 2005, two at the now-defunct The Downtown in Farmingdale, NY, with proceeds going to charity, and a spot on The Used's tour at the Hammerstein Ballroom.  &gt; After some mysterious updates on their website, the 2007 Glassjaw tour had gone and ended, already hitting up spots including yet another venue in Farmingdale, NY, playing 2 shows in one day at The Crazy Donkey.  &gt; Glassjaw's next album is highly anticipated, not only due to their last full-length release dating back to 2002, but also the delay and lack of information regarding its status and/or release. In an interview with Palumbo in the July, 2006 issue of AP magazine, he stated that the band were in the process of writing and recording new material for the next album, which they hoped to release in 2007. Palumbo hinted that there could be a unifying concept behind the album. In November, 2007, in the first Glassjaw interview in years, Beck revealed they had written ""about eleven good songs -- seven i love, and four to six half-baked ideas we need to finish"".  &gt; In an interview with Kerrang!, Palumbo stated that the new album should be released by ""The end of this year or early 2009...I hope."" Details emerged from The Grixer in May, 2008 that the album was ""awaiting vocals"" and ""should be wrapped up and completed in the coming months"". In a May, 2008 interview with Verse One magazine, Beck said: ""Right now I’d just be happy to finish up this record. I’m sure if it’s not a giant pile of shit, we’d love to play it live. Exact dates, plans, don’t know yet."" In a June, 2008 interview conducted by Glassjaw.net, Beck stated, ""As far as I am personally concerned, there will be a release well before the end of the year.""  &gt; On August 6–8, 2010, the band released a 7"" vinyl single for ""All Good Junkies Go to Heaven"" spraypainted green and pink on either side of the vinyl at the UK's Hevy Fest. This is the first official Glassjaw release since 2005's El Mark EP[/album. On August 8, 2010 via MerchDirect, ""All Good Junkies Go To Heaven"" became available for purchase. Within hours of availability, the vinyl had sold out. Shortly thereafter, in addition to the launch of the single, a ""one-take"" live video of their 2008 song ""You Think You're (John Fucking Lennon)"" was posted on the official Glassjaw website. On September 8, Glassjaw announced the release of another vinyl single for release on September 9, 2010 for the song ""Jesus Glue"", as well as a digital download for ""All Good Junkies Go To Heaven"" in various formats. On September 23, GlassJaw posted a video for the song, ""Stars"", a reworked version of ""Star Above my Bed"", a fan favorite. As they did with ""Junkies"" and ""Jesus Glue,"" October 10 saw the release of yet another vinyl, ""Natural Born Farmer"" and the digital release of ""Jesus Glue.""  &gt; At 11:11AM on January 11, glassjaw.com began streaming a studio recording of ""Gold"". The website's background was changed to a live band photo with the text ""coloring book, the extended play. available exclusively at venue. gratis."" After the first concert on their 2011 tour, February 13, 2011, the new EP Coloring Book was given away free to each fan that attended the concert. Glassjaw played two shows in the UK, at the London HMV Forum (March 30) and the Cardiff Solus (March 31), with support from Napalm Death and also headlined Soundfest (June 10), playing alongside other artists such as Brother Ali, Del the Funky Homosapien and If He Dies He Dies. The band also played the Radio 1 / NME Stage at Reading and Leeds Festival in August 2011.  &gt; Glassjaw played their first and only scheduled show so far in 2012 in support of Rise Against's Endgame tour. It was the only show Glassjaw opened for them on the tour. A Day To Remember, The Menzingers, Architects, Touché Amoré, and Title Fight are also supporting selected dates. Glassjaw have been added to the Sonisphere festival line-up and will perform Worship &amp; Tribute in its entirety during their set. However, it was announced on March 29, 2012 via Sonishere's website that the festival was canceled due to issues in setting up the festival. As a result, the band have scheduled a date at New York's Irving Plaza to play the album in its entirety. The band have also been announced to be playing Hevy Festival 2012, alongside acts such as Converge, Rolo Tomassi and Will Haven. This will mark Glassjaw's second time playing at the festival, and the first since headlining it in 2010. Read more on Last.fm.

54980,They are two heads of the same beast..... credit rating agencies like Equifax and TransUnion measure the ability to pay of individuals or businesses.   They do this by using the information that lenders provide to them. However they also rate those very same lenders.... so if a lender doesn't like their own rating they may stop giving the rating agency information making the rating agency less useful. Thus rating agencies have an incentive to always rate large lenders high.   Individuals are also rated by the agencies but are not as big a priority. Often times information on individuals is left out or not accurate and the agencies don't really care unless the  businesses that pay them complain about it. I have on countless occasions done credit checks on businesses that appear to be clean.... only to see them declare bankruptcy within the next year.  Like I said... the current rating system is broken and I have no doubt that within the next 5 years new legislation will come out to try and reform them.,canada

15700,"&gt; Our system is by no means perfect but it's the greatest economic system in the history of the world that has provided the most wealth and happiness to the greatest number of people. Name another system as good as capitalism, you can't. Venezuela collapsing is from moving away from capitalism and towards a more communistic system - which is pretty much exactly what you're advocating. You're just rebranding the name.   This is partially true. The government isn't interested in an economic system that works. The government know exactly how to make this economy boom but is unwilling to do it. The truth is that Capatalism is the absolute best way to rob society because it all looks so good on paper. This way, the people don't complain and the government extracts cash and energy out of the economy without hindrance. So ya, in that way, Capatlism is the best system. Its the easiest on sleeping humans while extremely profitable for the cabal until the humans wake up and realize they were robbed blind of course.   &gt;I didn't misread anything. You stated in your second point that people would have to continue working their jobs for a year whenever your system is implemented. Your words not mine. By the way nothing is stopping people from deciding what jobs they want to do now. Western culture has the greatest mobility of any culture because people have the freedom to choose what they want to do and as long as they are good enough at it to make money they can continue doing it.   I was only recommending that people stick to their jobs until they find a replacement. Most people are hindered from following their dreams simply because there's no money in the venture. Take out the money and free everyone so that they can pursue their dreams.   &gt;People have to be motivated. You work harder (and through your hard work make society better) to earn more money to live a better life. Why would someone work near as hard when they know all they have to do is show up and work half ass for 5 hours and they still get whatever they want. Which by the way, how will we have enough resources for this? If everyone can just swipe a card and get free stuff what's the limit to how much they can get? If there's no limit people will get whatever they want and over use our limited resources.   In Sacred Economics, we will all work hard to build a wealthy society so that we can all enjoy it. Can you imagine the type of cooperation that would occur among people when everyone has the same exact goal in mind? People will consume as they go. Hoarding would be illegal. If anyoen is found to be reasonably hoarding, they would have to account for the mistake and fix it. Simple. If they are too stupid to understand why hoarding would kill the entire economy, we would have to send them to educational classes explaining the benefits of playing by the rules of society so that it works for all of us. There are always douchbags who are arrogant enough to thik they can somehow outsmart the system and get away with it but we, the people, will policie ourselves for the most part but if someone is really breaking the rules, we would have a court session. Punishment will no longer be used though.. only educational and emotional rehabilitation which actually works.   I've thought this through for over a year. I have a solution for any problem you throw at me.   ",conspiracy

For continuing Tomb of Sargeras progression and looking forward towards the Antorus raid, we will be raiding three days per week (Thursday, Sunday, and Monday from 7:30pm to 10:30pm server time). We also have raids for the Normal level of the current tier on Wednesday that are mandatory at the beginning of the tier and change to optional after the first month.      While we pride ourselves on our friendly community and non-toxic raiding environment, we do expect all members of our raiding team to come fully prepared and focused to our raids. We are able to create this unique environment by respecting our fellow raid members and the time, effort, and dedication that every other member of our team is putting in each day. As such, we prefer players who are excited about raiding and look forward to learning and working to progress through new content.      **Contact**   If you are interested in joining our community, please feel free to contact Branches or Joséphines in game. I can also be reached on BattleTag at Branches#21688 or via Discord at Branches#0460. Joséphines can also be reached via Discord at Jo (Joséphines)#4873. We look forward to hearing from you!  ",wow

I understand that the military could do a better job in preserving civilian lives but during the Obama administration there was an executive order which sought to   &gt; formalizes procedures that must be undertaken after &gt; strikes, requires an annual report on civilian casualties outside “areas of active hostilities""  I'm not saying this justifies the thousands of civilian deaths and casualties, but at least it shows that the government is aware and trying to limit the casualties?

38083,"Oh, I think I gotcha. You're saying that people are now fine with Amazon's regular technical difficulties and big paywall and Netflix' way of releasing shows because they don't like the shows currently airing on those services.   In that case, first of all my opinion on that: I think you're wrong. People are still complaining about things. The problems with Netflix and especially Amazon didn't go away just because some shows are poorly received. I think what is making you believe that people are fine with it now is that you don't see the complaints on reddit as much anymore. That is probably because you will see most of them during the time when the services announce which shows they licensed and not as much in the episode discussion threads. As I said, the problems are still there and you will see the discussions again when we start getting news for the next season.   And second, one thing I want to mention: I think your title and even the post itself are very misleading if this is the point you're making. A title like that and the post mostly being critiques (if you can call Digibro's and Best Guy Ever's mindless nitpicky bashing a critique) makes it seem like you just want to bash the shows yourself, basically saying ""look at you and your hype, you were wrong"". Next time you want to make a point or start a discussion about the problems with certain streaming services you might want to make the post mostly about that. Using just these two shows and some critique as reference for that just doesn't work out well, as you can see by how well your post is received by people and comments entirely missing the Netflix/Amazon point.",anime

Aside from this it was almost cliché-free. I also loved the way the movie depicted the most mundane deaths - usually it's the combat roles that grab the most honourable mentions, but in Dunkirk it depicts those trapped below decks meeting their ends as much as anybody. The music was a bit cloying (too much ''something's about to happen'' quickening of the tempo) but otherwise sufficiently moody and dense.

Beatitude is a somewhat more experimental variation of The Cars' New Wave rock sound. A more synthesizer-heavy follow up, This Side Of Paradise, was released in 1986. A minor hit, ""Emotion In Motion"" accompanied the album.  &gt; The Cars split in 1987, and Ocasek disappeared from the public eye for several years, resurfacing in 1990 with Fireball Zone. One track, ""Rockaway"", enjoyed a brief stay on the charts, but his solo albums have seen disappointing sales, especially compared to his success with the Cars. He subsequently released other solo works throughout the decade, including 1993's Quick Change World, 1996's Getchertikitz (a collaboration with Suicide's Alan Vega), and 1997's Billy Corgan-produced Troublizing (which Ocasek supported with a very brief tour, his first since leaving the Cars). In 2005, Ocasek released another album, Nexterday, to little fanfare but positive reviews.  &gt; In 2010, Ocasek reunited with the surviving original members of The Cars to record their first album in 24 years, titled Move Like This, which came out on May 10, 2011.

If the Chargers ended up with the top pick next year, they have a solid core and defense and a QB whose on the wrong side of 30.   ",nfl

69339,"Here is a video for source https://youtu.be/TTHdeGWWGgk The scene cuts with Cersei still in Maggie's hut. Book readers know that Maggie gives the last bit about the Valonquar for free not as an answer to one of the questions. Not showing Cersei leave the hut leaves room for more that could have been said but not shown. Jamie doesn't know about the prophecy so he doesn't have the same hate for Tyrion as Cersei does. She has already asked him to kill Tyrion after Joffery and Jamie refuses. If she asks again he might ask why the hate, Jamie doesn't believe Tyrion killed Joffery. She then could explain the prophecy to him. The show only reveled the first half of the prophecy because that's all that was relevant to the current seasons story plot. The books introduce plots and leave them hanging for a long time.  R+L=J was known by every book reader for years now. Not directly but in the book there was plenty of clues. If you only watch the show and never google book spoilers then it would've been a huge revelation! The show makes it clear Jon is lianna's baby by cutting to him from the babies face.

During the 1970s he issued 18 singles and four albums, including ""Rebel"" (1976), ""Stranger In The City"" (1977), and ""Zaragon"" (1978). He had most success with singles; in addition to Music, he also charted with ""Highfly"" (1975), ""Remember Yesterday"" (1976), and ""Slow Down"" (1977). Most of his songs were co-written with his bassist Bob Marshall.  &gt; Miles has toured with Tina Turner, often filling in for Bryan Adams when the latter was unavailable to join her on tour for their duet. Miles is also a frequent guest vocalist on albums by The Alan Parsons Project.  &gt; In the 1980s he continued to record and tour. In 1983 a new radio station in the south of England, Radio Mercury, used parts from the song ""Music"" for their link jingles. The actual song itself also received extensive airplay on the station, leading one to speculate this was perhaps part of a deal for the usage in their jingles.  &gt; A list of Miles album releases from the 1980s and 1990s is as follows: Sympathy (1980)  Miles High (1981)  John Miles' Music (1982)  Play On (1983)  Transition (1985)  John Miles Live In Concert (1992)  Anthology (1993)  Upfront (1993)  Master Series (1998)  Tom and Catherine (1999)  Millennium Edition (1999)  &gt; Throughout the late 80s and into the 90s John Miles was musical director to Tina Turner on her various tours, and played on several of her albums. He also played Hammond organ on Joe Cocker's album ""Night Calls""(1992). Today he is still making music, which he famously refers to as his ""first love"".  &gt; In 2002 he issued the DVD ""John Miles - Live In Concert."" Read more on Last.fm.

The final combined product is excessively long, and I don’t want to torture you all by reading all of it.  I’ll select a few that I think I have something substantial to say about and put them below.  [If you want to read about what I thought about the rest of the shows I completed, I’ll throw them all in a Google doc here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-LCaG-uHcg-G-iwWT3LHSuZ1qkiPAcDcbhSzQkZaK6g/edit?usp=sharing)  -----  **Alice to Zouroku**  **Final Score: 7.4**  **MAL Score: 7/10**  My feelings about this show can be summed up as such:  **I like it when Sana is the subject, but I hate it when Sana is an object.**  To put things in simpler terms, the show is great when it focuses on Sana doing things, but its lower points come when things are happening to or around Sana.  The only character in this series who needs actual substantial growth as a human being is Sana.  Most of the cast are adults who either have their lives completely together (Zouroku) or are just deluded in their self-righteousness (Minnie C).  Those aren’t the people we should be focusing on.  Arguably along the same vein, neither should we be focusing on Sanae or the other kids who have Dreams of Alice.  They also are able to teach Sana many things about life and the outside world.  So making Sana the main heroine is the most logical conclusion because she needs the most development, making her a good candidate to experience the “Hero’s Journey” trope or whatever you want to call it.  But it baffles me so when they decided to make her the loli in distress during the first arc.  Sana is the “object” that is being fought over, and it completely undermines her development as a person.  You could argue that it’s Zouroku who is getting the development, but as I said earlier, he doesn’t need it.  He just blinks into existence in the car during Episode 4(?), and gives a speech to Minnie C about how he’s not taking any of her crap.  While his speech was indeed this highlight of that episode, he already entered with these convictions in mind, so we can’t really call that development.  At best, it shows how much Sana means to Zouroku.    In fact, it is only such a highlight because it is more of a development of Sana than anything else.  It is a change in perspective on how Sana sees herself: as a human person who is loved rather than a tool.  The first half (with the exception of Episode 2, but especially Episode 5) was indeed the weaker of the two in the series because it treated Sana as an object rather than a subject.  The second half reverses this.  When Sana became the subject of the story, the series got a lot better.  Yes, the second half is a lot of slice of life elements.  Episode 5 was by far the most hype because of the fighting, but it was also by far the least meaningful.  The second half of this series, while a lot less action, is also the most impactful.  It works because it is about Sana learning about a lot of things and (I’ll really drive this point home again) developing as a person.  Episode 6 is where Sana learns about the concept of family and gets officially adopted by Zouroku.  Episode 7 is where she learns about what friends are, this concept that she had a vague idea of in her mind but could never quite put it to words.  Even the drama with Hatori and Ayumi all helped morally develop Sana.  Sana learned empathy and more about the gray area between right and wrong.  Sana got herself into most of her troubles, but she mostly got out by her own hand.  That is brilliant from a development standpoint.  And Hatori was the perfect foil for Sana to help process these feelings.  I think if this show knew what it wanted to be, this would easily be a top 5 of the season (minus sequels).  It has strong slice of life moments that actually didn’t feel meaningless like most in that genre.  But it also had these weird serious moments where A) we’ve seen them before done better, and B) contributed nothing to the development of Sana (or anyone for that matter).  Geez, Episode 5 wasted so much of my time that it just pisses me off.  -----  **Eromanga-sensei**  **Final Score: 7.1**  **MAL Score: 7/10**  Here’s a weird thought, in terms of accomplishing its goals, Eromanga-sensei was actually the 3rd best anime of the season (of what I’ve seen) behind Tsuki ga Kirei and SukaSuka.  Think about it: what was Eromanga-sensei trying to sell?  An otaku-bait show featuring a loli harem with the intent of getting them into risqué positions.  Can we check off all of those boxes?  With a huge, giant check.  But on a serious note, this show was just a gigantic mess.  It’s impossible to take this show seriously.  Some characters were just absolutely inconsequential to the overall plot.  “Megumin” and bookstore girl should have been more present for essentially being the Ayase and the Manami of the show.  The third place guy did absolutely nothing but make quips and jabs for how many times he appeared.  We got two Kuronekos this time in Elf and Muramasa.  That’s fine.  I liked Kuroneko.  BUT, I don’t think two people should occupy her role as the “otaku companion”, even if her personality is split among the two of them to make the seem different.  Episode 11 was Muramasa confessing to Masamune in more or less the same manner as Elf did in Episode 10.  Could’ve just saved us the grief by having both of them be the same character and only devoting one episode to that confession.  Then develop more of the main plot elsewhere.  For a show called “Eromanga-sensei”, we actually didn’t get very much Eromanga-sensei.  I felt like a lot of the show was Masamune hanging out with Elf and Muramasa, and then the rest was Sagiri getting mad at him for doing so.  There were very few moments that made Sagiri stand out as a character, and some episodes she’s just missing entirely.  Fine, gimme the harem, but focus on the main girl at least, unless they’re playing the long con and Elf or Muramasa is the one he gets with (which I’m totally okay with).  I will say that the Sagiri moments were some of the few moments of the series that felt well done and developed.  Sagiri slowly coming out of her shell was a nice development that I wish could have been more of the focus of this show.  But no, we get an episode devoted to ochinchin instead.  I don’t know what to say about the ending except that was the lamest, passive, lazy ending that I’ve ever seen, which almost certainly guarantees this a season 2.  -----  **Fukumenkei Noise**  **Final Score: 8.5**  **MAL Score: 8/10**  Let’s get one thing straight before I start here.  For the amount of praise I gave this show for its amazing use of symbolism and deep dialogue, I was never actually really invested in the romance itself.  Part of this may be because it was running in the same season as SukaSuka and Tsuki ga Kirei, two absolutely stellar romance series that will probably become comparisons for how I judge romance anime for a while.  It also ran alongside Renai Boukun and Eromanga-sensei, two anime that need to go die in a fire.  Fukumenkei Noise fell somewhere in the middle for me.  It may also have something to do with the fact that this show is a shoujo, therefore I am not its target audience by default.  But the irony of this statement is that Kimi ni Todoke is somewhere in my Top 5 anime of all time at the moment, so I dunno.  Fukumenkei Noise is probably only the second shoujo romance I’ve ever watched, so I’m pretty new to the entire genre.  So sure, maybe I wasn’t invested, but that doesn’t mean that I didn’t like it.  And I think this part was largely helped by the symbolism and the deep dialogue.  I cam empathize better with the characters when I know their thought processes, and this series did a pretty good job conveying each character’s wants and needs (even though they couldn’t do the same towards each other).  As a musician myself, I could definitely relate to the emotions they felt when playing and writing music.  I’ve talked at length before about the beauty that is the symbolism of the scenarios.

Rap's claim to fame has been both tackling incredibly difficult topics as well as bragging about one's accomplishments and how they've earned it.

The other tournaments don't matter nearly as much, especially when they ultimately couldn't win and kept coming in 2nd. 2nd place is sometimes worse than last, as seen from the breakdown of Zeus na'vi where there was a lot of tension and frustration and blame on the team which couldn't win and always came in 2nd during the zeus era, which lead to them backstabbing and kicking him behind his back. I think a few members like guardian/seized even publicly said that Zeus lost his team and the team was in disarray and they stopped listening to his calls and lost trust in him and Zeus has said it himself that he lost his team and they no longer accepted him as their leader and stopped listening and trusting him anymore (and if you look back in their interviews, they were all very unhappy and even seemed resentful with the results and blamed Zeus for not being able to pull his weight). Guardian also said once that he felt coming in 2nd all the time and not being able to win felt hopeless and that it felt good to finally win and to prove to himself they can actually win (after their win at ESL ONE NY with s1mple).  There's also been studies done (google it if you don't believe me) that show that silver Olympic winners are the least happiest out of all the medalists (gold, silver, and bronze) and are most likely to be disappointed and angry at themselves and bronze medalists were overall happy and much more happier than silvers (because most were happy to just to get a medal) while silver medalists felt that they failed or fell short. And obviously gold medalists were the happiest overall. The even worse part was let alone getting 2nd, they bombed out at the most important event of the year 0-3 in the group stages and failed to get legend status. And faze's twitter (meaninglessly) tweeted that this result was unacceptable right after, which seems odd since most teams don't usually release statements regarding their failures or address it publicly, so I felt the faze management must have been distraught or severely disappointed in this team and their results at the major, and no longer believed in them to ultimately be able to win, which lead to this change.",GlobalOffensive

14013,"It's actually possible, and one of the worst things about having ""parallel"" systems involved in ranked. League of Legends, Rocket League, Heroes of the Storm, and pretty much any other game that uses the ""tiered"" rank system suffers the same problem.  Basically, you have a ""hidden"" MMR (often based on the Elo system with some variations depending upon the type of game/match you are being ranked for) that *actually* determines who you play against, that technically has no real connection to your displayed rank. So you could theoretically have an MMR that's close to the average for a high Platinum/low Diamond player while being visually displayed/ranked as a ""Gold"" player (or the reverse, have a ""low"" MMR but a high rank). Usually this is caused by winning or losing streaks, or doing really well or really poorly in placements and early on in your ranked career. LoL (and maybe some others with similar systems) also has the issue of only advancing via a best-of-3/5 series, so you can win virtually every game and still have bad luck in your promotion series and be stuck in a low rank with a high MMR/Elo.  It's a definite problem that is observed by many players on a fairly regular basis. Get on a winning streak after a losing streak and you'll run into the problem temporarily almost every time - having to play against players that are ""better"" than you in rank just to advance ahead of the other players that are ""the same"" as you in rank.",Overwatch

De-humidifiers were running non-stop, and we had to rig up little rollers with fabric softener to keep the film separating in the right way before the brain. Sometimes during really bad days, we would have an employee sit up there to separate the film with cotton-gloved fingers as it rolled off the reel. So many times where it dumped on the floor, tangled, melted or caused headaches for everyone.

But all that wouldn't have been enough if Spain fully found their way into the game. Instead, they were shifting their momentum a lot (being passive for 25 minutes, pressing for 15 minutes) to confuse our defence when it really just made it harder for them to get into their flow.  And even with all that accounted for; Kimmich's header was anything but a 100% chance and if that one missed and it ended 0-0 at the 90th minute I just cannot imagine how the german team could possibly hold the same amount of intensity for another 30 minutes.

38377,"&gt;Breaking it down into race and sex is relevant as it can be an indicator of what is going on.  Ok you lost me here. How is this at all a good ""indicator of what's going on""? You said yourself that people can no longer support themselves and their family in the current job market. I completely agree, jobs are flowing out of Canada thanks to corporate monopolies and outsourcing. The price of living skyrocketed in recent decades and wages can not rise in accordance. Race has jack shit to do with any of this. Canadians are being forced ignore that the needs of international corporate entities are being placed before the needs of the Canadian people. ""breaking it down into race"" is a way to distract people from the real problems and get the population fighting amongst themselves. A perpetually divided nation will never be able to organise and ensure the ruling powers functions for the well being of the nation. An international corporate entity is not loyal to any one nation, their only interest is to ensure that the people of the nations in which they do business do not impede their means of profit. This ""diversity is a strength"" tripe being pushed on Canadians is a monument to this. Not only does the importation of low payed workers benefit corporate monopolies, it also further divides and ""diversifies"" the nation rendering it rudderless as it is occupied with the social disarray caused by lack of consensus and unity.

66907,"Now, not to say there isn't a problem with the system, BUT:  1- When action is taken, they can't give us details. The most they could tell us is that action has been taken against someone we reported, but they couldn't provide additional details for multiple reasons.  2- They cannot possibly follow up on every individual report. Multiple reports need to be given about the individual before they'll investigate. If you, and everyone else, stops reporting, action will never be taken.  3- Due to the above, it could take time before any action is taken, depending on how quickly people report.  Any kind of repercussion system is difficult to balance. You do not want to spend your time chasing ghosts (people reported for throwing because they're playing an off meta hero in a game), and you do not want to ban someone for a crime they didn't commit (some accused of aimbotting who just has really good aim).

I think Armstrong is building for another cup window in 2-4 years, and paying $6 million for a ~37 year old Backes in a few years would really work against us.  Brouwer wasn't that great to start with, and it seems like he's only gotten worse this season. I think we dodged a bullet by letting him go.   Elliott specifically asked to be traded, and losing him has given Allen a chance to step up and develop his game more. It also gives us an open goalie spot this/next year for one of our goalie prospects to move up.  It sucked to lose all three players at the same time, but I think Armstrong wants to build a cup window around Tarasenko's prime. Keeping older players like Backes and Brouwer around would have made us better at the moment, but by getting rid of them we're extending our cup window by a lot.",hockey

The band consists of Christian Zucconi (vocals, guitar), Hannah Hooper (vocals, keyboards), Andrew Wessen (vocals, guitar), Sean Gadd (bass, vocals), and Ryan Rabin (drums). The band released their debut album, Never Trust a Happy Song, in September 2011, which was followed by Spreading Rumours, released September 2013. Both albums were produced by the band's drummer Ryan Rabin, who is the son of former Yes guitarist and film composer Trevor Rabin.  &gt; Hannah Hooper met Christian Zucconi late one evening on the lower east side of Manhattan. They had both been living in New York for years and had never crossed paths before. But from that night forward the two could hardly be pulled apart. Soon after their connection, Hooper was invited to an art residency in Greece on the island of Crete and Hooper insists ""without any hesitation"" she invited Zucconi to join her on this journey. ""Seriously, we had only known one another for a few days but are both so inspired and alive when we are together that going to Greece seemed like a magical and natural thing to do,"" recalls Zucconi.  &gt; On Crete, in a small remote mountain village, Hooper and Zucconi met the members of their future band ""GROUPLOVE"" a year before it was officially formed. Sean Gadd, a natural songwriter and guitar player, born and bred in London instantly bonded with the two eccentric New Yorkers. Their relationship became apparent through the music they were making day in and day out. Andrew Wessen, a pro surfer and musician from Los Angeles and his childhood friend Ryan Rabin, an accomplished drummer and producer, were also at the residency and quickly joined in with the musical trio. These five musicians make up the members of what we now know as GROUPLOVE .  &gt; Like all good things, the summer and the residency came to an end and the five friends scattered back to their homes all over the globe. With Sean in London, Christian and Hannah in Brooklyn and Ryan and Andrew in Los Angeles GROUPLOVE was faced with the challenge of what to do now. ""We all understood how rare it is for five strangers to feel as close as family and create passionate music together. We couldn't just return to Brooklyn and let the music we all made fade into a memory of that summer we had in Greece,"" explains Zucconi. Everyone pulled their funds together and Sean, Christian and Hannah made their way to Ryan Rabin's studio in LA to record their album. ""We seriously had the best time of our lives doing that record,"" says Gadd. And the result is an incredibly special album where soaring harmonies coupled with sweeping anthems lead you through their powerful journey. Like the members of GROUPLOVE, their music is diverse in influence and style but bonded together by an undeniably creative kinship.  &gt; Their experience back together and recording together was so potent that Hooper and Zucconi packed up their lives in Brooklyn and Gadd packed up his life in London and they all moved to LA to live and play their music.  &gt; ""We never could have dreamt this up,"" says Zucconi, ""but at the same time we're not at all surprised - GROUPLOVE is meant to be.

It also doesn't make sense for elephants which are long lived because they have communities and shared knowledge, so killing one even if it is old, is a blow to the community.  Essentially the benefit to killing an old animal is in the money it raises to help further conservation. Wouldn't it be best if we didn't kill the animal and raised money other ways? Personally I think the killing is immoral and the reason we excuse it is because it is tied to this money.

There's [a range of views among them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish-speaking_population_of_Finland#Identity) from identifying as Finns to identifying as a distinct ethnicity within Finland to identifying as Swedes. &gt;According to a sociological study published in 1981, the Swedish-speaking Finns meet the four major criteria for a separate ethnic group: self-identification of ethnicity, language, social structure, and ancestry.[Note 24] However, not all Swedish-speaking Finns are willing to self-identify as representatives of a distinct ethnicity. The major political organisation representing the Swedish-speakers in Finland, the Swedish People's Party, has defined the Swedish-speaking Finns as a people who express Finnish identity in the Swedish language. The issue is debated: an opposite view is still that the Swedish-speaking Finns are a sub-group of the ethnic Swedes, östsvenskar or ""East Swedes"".

20080,"&gt;The word autumn comes from the ancient Etruscan root autu- and has within it connotations of the passing of the year.[11] It was borrowed by the neighbouring Romans, and became the Latin word autumnus.[12] After the Roman era, the word continued to be used as the Old French word autompne (automne in modern French) or autumpne in Middle English,[13] and was later normalised to the original Latin. In the Medieval period, there are rare examples of its use as early as the 12th century, but by the 16th century, it was in common use.  ...  &gt;The alternative word fall for the season traces its origins to old Germanic languages. The exact derivation is unclear, with the Old English fiæll or feallan and the Old Norse fall all being possible candidates. However, these words all have the meaning ""to fall from a height"" and are clearly derived either from a common root or from each other. The term came to denote the season in 16th century England, a contraction of Middle English expressions like ""fall of the leaf"" and ""fall of the year"".[16]  [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autumn)  ",funny

66019,"Well, not really.  I'm not aware of any license that's divvied up by country in its totality, but I could be wrong - it's not like I'm looking at license agreements on a daily basis, but then again, no one here is either, so it's always a little frustrating to see things like this stated with such certainty. Trying to assess motivation is also very odd - wouldn't you want your anime to be seen by the most people possible? The anime industry in Japan values things like relationships and what the fans want more than looking at dollars and cents (and even if that weren't the case, a particular individual on the internet may not be the best judge of what's the most profit-maximizing way to do business on an international stage).  Licenses are grouped usually by region, and every region is organized differently by each publisher. You can find out what publisher Crunchyroll is licensing from on the show page, but there's certainly some nuance to that. You'll find trends by publisher, which reveal some interesting licensing insights if you pay close enough attention, but broadly, it comes down to competition. If it were as straightforward as a menu of countries that you could purchase, sure, that'd be helpful, but without going into too much detail, that's just not how licensing works, and that doesn't consider opportunity cost on the side of publishers in a world where every region has its own players.  When Crunchyroll licenses anime, we try to get as many countries as possible. For anime licensed from other Western partners, like Love Live Sunshine!! (via Funimation), we're limited to the countries that the partner licensed for. Funimation, for example, previously only had service available in the English-speaking world, so it didn't make sense for them to license globally - even if they want the rights for regions they don't immediately serve, the publisher would be most interested in local partners who are most capable of exploiting the most rights (local TV, localized merchandise, home video, etc.).  So for this title in particular, getting additional rights just wasn't on the table necessarily, and the process of changing the rights available is unbearably complex. It's a frustrating reality, but that's where we are. I'm really excited about CR's upcoming Summer line-up, keep track of how many of the titles are available in 150+ countries ;)",anime

It is March 1945, and the Germans have been pushed back by the Russians into Germany and Czechoslovakia. He was scouting some German village in the Sudetenland. A Russian platoon drove around, so he hid in a caved out building, so this lone sniper had a front row seat to the horror to what was to follow. The platoon was plundering the village until it ran into this German couple. The Russians then tied up the husband, and forced him to watch as the Russians, in order of ranking personnel, raped the wife. One. By. One. She was screaming in agony, fell in and out of consciousness, and was in so much pain. When the last Russian was finished with her, he shoved a flare gun up the woman's vagina, and fired it. The woman screamed out the most 'animalistic, brutal, and haunting scream' the German has ever heard, as the flare was slowly burning the woman's insides and blood/flare residue/flames were rushing out of her body, and then she slumped over dead. German reinforcements soon arrived, and killed/wounded the platoon. The husband went into his house, grabbed an object (I recall it was a shovel) and hacked the remaining wounded Russians on the ground until they were all dead. Some of the Germans tried stopping him, but the lone sniper held them back.""  The way I heard that originally was that the German reinforcement heard the man's story and one of the soldier's handed him a shovel and then they left him alone with the Russians.",AskReddit

42108,"Thank you. I stumbled across this theory last night, and thought I'd offer some explanation.  These so called ""accounts"" aren't real. That's why you're hearing non-stop about these transactions getting reversed. The reason that they appear to go through in the first place is that these people are attempting transactions with valid routing numbers for Federal Reserve and US Treasury banks.  Normally, when making a payment online with a checking account, the routing and account numbers are verified, and the transaction is sent to the bank. The Federal Reserve's routing numbers, however, are not consumer banks. I do not think that the account numbers are verified in the same way. The routing number is valid, and the transaction is sent to be processed.  When it hits the Fed's bank account, there are a few possibilities:  There is no such account number, so the transaction is reversed.  There is an account with that number, but because of name and address are incorrect it is declined and reversed.  There is an account with that number, it goes through. You've now committed interstate wire fraud.  In response to this, many websites and services have either started properly verifying the accounts, or are just completely blocking routing numbers from non-consumer government banks.  Anyone who has a solid understanding of ACH payment processing would see this immediately. These people offer absolutely no tangible evidence that there are actual accounts that are in their name, at least not that I've seen.  What really makes me sick is that there are people out there, who say they will help you access these alleged accounts for a fee. They're charging people money, and essentially stealing their personal information and using it for their personal gain. Absolutely disgusting.  I had never even thought about the possibility of this being use by our governments to identify people who hold certain beliefs. But you're right. You're literally handing your full name and SSN to a Federal Reserve bank and telling them that you've fallen for this BS propaganda. ",conspiracy

You can source yourself to see how many lawsuits have been publicized in the press by employees who have been harmed by the actions or inaction of their employers related to PTSD.  One RCMP officer just filed last week for constructive dismissal for suffering PTSD.  Every employer in Canada has two duties:  1). The duty to assist - requires that employers assist injured employees to the point of undue hardship.  2). The duty to refer - requires that employers refer injured employees to medical professionals when it's clear they are unable to perform their duties.  Countless cases show an endemic problem with first line responders not being assisted while injured on the job.  A simple online search should turn up many.  Let's be clear what WCB does when a claim for PTSD is received.  They require the claimant to undergo an IME - independent medical exam, except it's anything but independent.  Rather a paid hack that is hand picked by WCB will ""test"" and interview the claimant and then deny the claim for frivolous and obscure reasons.  I know one individual injured on the job, suffering from PTSD (diagnosed by both Health Canada &amp; an independent psychiatrist) who had to sue the government for compensation and permanent disability.

23451,"&gt; From both novels and wc3 games prior to Legion, we know that Illidan does ultimately have the best intentions for Azeroth.  I'm not sure where you were seeing this. RoC it was because Tyrande asked him to, as well as the prospect of gaining more power. TFT was because KJ coerced him into destroying LK, or face destruction himself. The novels have shown how power hungry Illidan was, as well as his own magic addiction. Let's not forget how half the time he was trying to impress Tyrande.                   &gt; his ultimate goal was to save Azeroth.

We had no Science, no History, no Geography... no other specific courses than French, English, Maths, and Physcial Education (and even the latter worked in a special way). Instead, we had four to ten research projects ending in an oral presentation every year, starting in kindergarten (of course, no much depth was demanded from a kindergartener) in order, mainly, to teach us to look for stuff on our own.  Pedagogical philosophy aside, it resulted in oral presentations being the foundation of my schooling.  And yet I *still* end pretty much every unscripted public speech with ""so... that was it"". It's not that I couldn't find alternatives, or that I never think about it a little in advance and find myself interrupted in my own train of thoughts by ending my own presentation; there just *isn't* anyway to end a speech that doesn't sound artificial or dumb.

What people are displaying all over is the Confederate *battle* flag. There's some leniency in national laws for flying foreign flags -- even those of unfriendly nations. But flying the battle flag of a hostile nation is considered one step removed from treason. Flying the ""Stars'n'Bars"" is tantamount to flying the Japanese Rising Sun flag or the Nazi reichskriegsflagge -- being a declaration of hostile intent toward the United States of America.  Nothing about ""Southern Culture"" (as if there were one single such thing) or ""Southern Heritage"" (again, all over the place). It's glamorizing an act of rich white male landowners not wanting to make any effort to find another way to potentially maintain their lifestyle than on the backs of other human beings they were keeping in crushing ignorance and poverty (white *and* black, often overlooked), and then carried off one of the greatest cons ever by convincing poor *white* Southerners to fight their war for them, on the pretext of ""protecting"" them from the invading imperialist Government, because hey -- at least they weren't *black*.  A whooooole lot of those who answered the call were immigrants from -- or children of immigrants from -- Scotland and Ireland, who had been poor tenant farmers run off their land by their landlords and/or the English to make way for more profitable sheep. So they were already leery of a strong central government which might potentially try to come in and do the same thing here.  And it's a war we're still fighting today, because we only beat the Confederacy militarily. Taking a cue from Sun Tzu, when that method didn't work, they changed tactics.",AskReddit

Even if he wasn't able to calculate the kid's strength, Cap at least knew that in terms of raw strength:  Cap &lt; Bucky &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Spider-Man   Since we already know Cap can lift a few tonnes, it doesn't take a super computer brain to figure out that Spider-Man could lift quite a few more considering how easily he overpowered both Cap and Bucky in terms of raw strength.

Those four are:  * English Freemasonry (the largest single group, including many spin-offs that mutally reocgnized each other such as the major Grand Lodges in the US states, at least one Grand Lodge in each European nation, Australia and so on). * ""Continental"" Freemasonry which started in France under the Grand Orient de France and has since spread to nearly every part of the globe under its primary auspices or related spinoffs like Le Droit Humain. * Prince Hall Freemasonry in the United States which began under segregation as the ""black Lodges"" but are now a wholly distinct tradition, variously recognized or not by each state's mainstream Grand Lodge. * Scandinavian Freemasonry is a hybrid of traditions that came out of France combined with the state Lutheran Churches of most Scandinavian countries. Very much a Christian-only spin on Freemasonry with a distinct look and allegorical basis. Recognized by the English Grand Lodges.  This doesn't count all of the side-orders and secondary groups like the Shriners, Scottish Rite, etc., all of which tend to be duplicated within each strain except for the Scandinavian traditions where they have a much more linear system of 10 degrees and few if any side-orders.

I like our Supreme Court. I generally agree with them. However, they have made several rulings in the last few years which are troublesome given that they imply jurisdiction outside of Canada.   This ruling by the SCOC also creates a problem in that now, 1. if Canada knows a person is being mistreated outside of Canada, and 2. the gov't knows it will be held complicit if they talk to that person; the solution seems to be not to have any contact.

I mostly agree with your post but this bit is profoundly out of keeping with what I see, read, and experience. I mean, simply going to a Tim Horton's or any fast-food restaurant will dispel any notion that minimum wage isn't anything but a protective veil supporting workers.   Its philosophical origin was intended to provide teenagers and newcomers to the economy a starting point but it has since then morphed into a catch-all for any unable to move up the economic ladder.   Automation is coming and it is here. We can expect labour to lose political power. But, the end result of an impoverished nation unable to find enough value for their time and energy leads to a feudalistic nation with extreme civil unrest.   Raising the minimum wage can help mitigate that civil unrest while we figure out what the hell to do about automation (UBI, Mincome, etc.)",canada

43838,"https://www.marxists.org/history/international/comintern/sections/britain/pamphlets/xx/jews.htm  &gt;ANTI-SEMITISM is defined as the spreading of enmity against the Jews. When the damnable Tsarist monarchy was living out its last hours, it attempted to divert the illiterate workers and peasants into pogroms against the Jews.  &gt;The Tsar’s police in union with the landlords and capitalists organised Jewish pogroms. They attempted to divert the natural hatred of the workers and peasants for the exploiters against the Jews.  &gt;Even in other countries one often experiences that the capitalists stir up enmity against the Jews, in order to divert the attention of the workers from the real enemy of the working masses, capital.  &gt;**Enmity against the Jews can only exist where the landowners and capitalists have kept the workers and peasants in complete illiteracy through bondage.**  &gt;Only entirely uneducated and completely oppressed people can believe the lies and slanders which are being spread about the Jews. These are survivals from the times of serfdom, when the priests burnt heretics at the stake, when peasants were trampled upon and were blind. But these dark survivals of serfdom are disappearing, the people are beginning to see.  &gt;It is not the Jews who are the enemies of the toilers. **The enemies of the workers are the capitalists of all lands.** Among the Jews there are workers, toilers, they are in the majority. They are our brothers, comrades in the struggle for Socialism, because they are oppressed by capitalism. Among the Jews there are Kulaks, exploiters, capitalists, **just like amongst us all.**  &gt;**The capitalists are tireless in their endeavours to stir up enmity between the workers of different faiths, different nations and different races. The rich Jews, just like the rich Russians and the rich of all countries, are united in trampling upon, oppressing and dividing the workers.**  &gt;Disgrace and infamy to the damnable Tsarism which tortured and persecuted the Jews! Disgrace and infamy to whoever sows enmity against Jews and hatred against other nations! Long live brotherly faith and unity in struggle of all nations, for the overthrow of capitalism!  *- Vladimir Lenin, from a gramophone record made during the Civil War, in 1919.*   &gt;There remains that universal historical tendency of capitalism to smash down national barriers, to erase national differences, to assimilate nations, which with each decade shows itself more powerfully, and which constitutes one of the greatest motive forces transforming capitalism into socialism.  &gt;He who does not acknowledge and defend the equality of nations and languages, he who does not fight against all forms of national oppression or inequality, is not a Marxist nor even a democrat. That is certain. But it is just as certain that he who pretends to be a Marxist, but violently attacks the Marxist of another nation or “assimilation” in practice, is just a petty bourgeois nationalist. . . .  &gt;The people who are shouting most against the “assimilationism” of the Russian orthodox Marxists4 are the Jewish nationalists in Russia, and in particular the Bundists. Yet, as can be seen from previously quoted figures, out of 10½ million Jews in the world about half live in the civilized world, in conditions of the greatest “assimilation,” while only the unfortunate, downtrodden, outlaw Jews of Russia and Galicia (crushed by the Purishkeviches, Russian and Polish), live in conditions of the least “assimilation,” the greatest segregation, including “Pales,” “percentage standards,” and other reactionary delights.  &gt;The Jews in the civilised world are not a nation, they have become most of all assimilated, affirm Karl Kautsky and Otto Bauer. The Jews in Galicia and Russia are not a nation, they unfortunately (and not through their fault, but owing to the Purishkeviches) are still a caste. This is the unquestioned conclusion of people who are unquestionably well informed in the history of the Jews.  &gt;What do these facts indicate? They indicate that “assimilation” can be denounced only by the Jewish reactionary petty bourgeois, who wish to turn back the wheel of history, and to force it to move, not from the conditions of Russia and Galicia to the conditions of Paris and New York, but in the opposite direction. . . .   *- Vladimir Lenin, October-December, 1913*",conspiracy

The truth of the matter that fat is a crucial part of our diet, especially from healthy sources such as nuts, fish, healthy oils like olive or coconut (corn and vegetable oil/pam are owned by the same people who sell the ""non-fat"" foods).  Eating a moderate to high amounts of fat is not unhealthy and does not lead to obesity as we are led to believe through the subliminal advertisements.

So getting something for Bradley instead of losing him in free agency next year makes perfect sense. That's the smartest thing to do in this case. I doubt they wanted to just outright part with Bradley because he was such a great player all around.  I think you can play the no loyalty card when a star player leaves after being offered a good contract to stay on a contending team. Ray Allen was a good example of this. We had everyone back from the previous year and he left for the Heat over, if I remember correctly, 2 million and 1 year difference during talks. We offered either the more money or the extra year. Again, Celtics fan, that's just an example that comes to my mind.  The Jazz, a few years ago, let Hayward try to find a better contract than he was asking for because they didn't think he was worth what he asked. When he couldn't find better they got him at what they wanted. If a team was willing to bet on you going to market, how can you blame him for wanting to go somewhere where the coach, team and fans really wanted him and are obviously giving a max contract? I know, another Celtics example, but I think it's still relevant and topical in this discussion.  Lastly, Paul Pierce. My favorite player. Love that guy. So sad to see him traded but again, it wasn't about loyalty. Pierce was not going to contribute the same way he always had and KG was getting injury prone. We were not getting better and we would only get worse going forward. Ainge traded them when he saw he could fleece the Nets big time. With their exit, we just got a great player in the draft and possibly more in the years to come because of that trade. It gave us something instead of nothing had we held on to Pierce and KG and just sucked or stayed average for multiple seasons. Pierce and KG still love Boston and Boston still loves them. Ainge talked with Pierce about the trade and Pierce had to convince KG it was OK and made sense because I think he had a no trade clause.  At the end of the day I think players should try and get the most for themselves in terms of money and success (NOT just money) and so should the teams themselves. Taking paycuts to stay with your team is obviously loyalty. Leaving a good team for a max contract to go to a shit team going nowhere, is more over the line of not being loyal and just being greedy. Yes I know sports players have a short career and should try to get the most money but I mean millions of dollars is  reasonable for any human being to live off of.",nba

8256,"Just had some counter-arguments I wanted to make.  &gt; Dany's dragons and her large army didn't help her much in Meereen so they are less effective at subduing a population than one would suspect.  This is saying a lot without really providing context. The problem with Meereen was how they were attacked. Also, Dany and co. didn't actually *know* the enemy, in the sense that they didn't *know* where/who to attack to stop it. Once they did, Dany burnt their fleet to the ground and killed 3 of their leaders. Pretty damn effective, if you ask me.  Unlike Meereen, Dany is going into the battle knowing who the enemy is, and the enemy isn't going to be able to hide in the shadows for long. Cersei will be forced to address Dany.  &gt; Wage a propaganda campaign against the Targaryens. Make Dany into a foreigner and a tyrant seeking to subjugate and oppress Westeros. Remind people of Dany's cray-cray father. Heck, blame Varys or Tyrion or some Targ loyalists for burning the Sept to the ground.  First off, no one in King's Landing considers Cersei in a positive manner. The general populace loathes her, and know the real kind of danger they are in with her at the helm. To suggest she could spin some shit to make the rightful Queen, who carries titles such as the Breaker of Chains, into a bad person, is just silly. Also, that isn't Cersei's style. She doesn't give a fuck what the public thinks of her, and loathes them equally as intensely as they for her. She'd rather burn them all then try and play some petty little opinion game.   This isn't High School; Dany has fucking fire-breathing dragons. The popular kid doesn't win here.  &gt; Ally with Euron and have him raid Dany's allies in Dorne and the Reach. Make it impossible for them to aid Dany because they have to defend their territories. Make both kingdom's banners, especially the Reach's banners, restless and ready to turn on Elia/Sandsnakes and Oleanna Tyrell. Promise lands to any defectors.  Totally reasonable. Euron is obviously aiding her, and the trailer suggests he's attacking them in open water. There is far too much to be gained by trying to disrupt Dany's allies while she is still traveling/plotting. This is the most logical move, and the most likely to happen. I see her trying to split Dany's group as soon as possible.  &gt; Ally with the North. Give Jon what he wants, men to defend the Wall. Sign a non-aggression pact with the North which acknowledges their independence. This will mean that Dany has to fight a war on two fronts; she would have to subdue the North as well because she wants everyone in Westeros to kneel to her. (Of course, Cersei won't do this either for the same power-hungry reason. I don't think that Tywin would either. However, a more reasonable Lannister like Tyrion or Kevan probably would see the value in making this move.)  That will never happen. Both sides are far too gone for such a truce, particularly when the obvious choice for Jon and the North would be to aid with the chick who has dragons, and who's ancestors allowed the Starks to rule the North after the Targs took control of Westeros.   Truth be told, Cersei and the Lannisters are a sinking ship. It would take a fucking miracle to revive them now, and even a further miracle to see them survive the shit storm coming their way. Cersei's diversion/division tactics will certainly have some effect, and Cersei will obviously gain some small victories, but Dany's dragons trump it all. Even with just Drogon, who is now a certified fucking monster, she can turn the tide in her favor to tremendous effect. The fact she obviously still had enough men to have the Doth Raki in open battle in one of those scenes, shows that the division tactic probably didn't do enough to stop what is coming for Cersei.  Honestly, Cersei's only chances for survival/victory hinge on what happens in the North, or if Euron *actually* has a Dragon Horn. At this point, it seems reasonable to believe that Euron has a horn, but what it will actually do in the show versus what it is said to do in the book, make it hard to really tell where they are going with it.  Finally, Cersei has the option to level the city with wildfire. It isn't below her to hold the city and it's people hostage, knowing the importance that Dany places in saving innocent lives. I'd be more inclined to believe that Cersei will level the city rather than give it up to Dany. It makes me wonder if Arya could have a part to play in that sequence of events that will lead up to Cersei's downfall, and Dany's eventual taking of King's Landing. Arya would fulfill the theory of her being the one to kill Cersei as per the prophecy from that crazy witch, and would give a smooth transition into an alliance for a bigger cause between the North and Dany.  Anyway, getting off topic now. Just wanted to share my thoughts on why Cersei is backed into a corner and not likely to get out, even if she causes massive damage and loss of life in the interim.

I feel they immensly sacrificied what could have been an amazing tone for the usual quips (and bad ones in this case), it totally kept the movie from having its own thing.    To make a mind bending movie you have to be ready to lose some of your audience and that's something Marvel can't do. They can't do psychedelism, they did pulp (and it works wonder for GotG but not for Strange). We should have had more visual storytelling, more symbolism and stuff beyond words. Here even when we are shown the beyond with those amazing visual effect, the Ancient One is giving some quite banale speech. The visual effects ended being more like fractal porn than something purposeful and interesting. Again fractal porn and trippy funky is cool for GotG (especially 2 with the spongey faces when they travel through dimension) but Strange has the potential to be so much more.   I am even more mad at Marvel because they have all the money, all the fans and all the material to propose something risky. I usually don't care about MCU stuff but I feel close to Strange because of similar life experience, it was such a mised opportunity. I mean, especially when the movie is supposed to open to ""infinite dimension"" and bring something fresh to Marvel's universe. It ended being the same old same old. They could have make something with a cool logic but in the end, substance and form didn't meet and it was all quite superficial, surface level and flat.

32584,"&gt;This is what was done with Fremer's file referenced in the article.  It was a claim made by a man who makes his living reviewing audiophile gear, some of it woo. Not only does he get the gear for free, he gets paid to review it. Him posting two files on the internet proves nothing. He's about as far from a disinterested observer without bias as you can get.  When people asked him questions about how it was recorded and so on it at Hydrogen Audio, he got huffed up and left. Fremer has actually taken part in blind listening tests, he promptly failed all of them.   [And there is no need for 24/96 masters. In a listening test no one can tell it apart from 6-bit/44.1.](http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=14195)  &gt;Side note: have you ever been in a reputable stereo store? Not Magnolia. Have you heard a big, powerful, low distortion stereo system properly set up, sans ""woo""?  Hey, at least you're not flat out saying that I haven't listened to enough high-resolving systems to be able to have a valid opinion. :)  I've been to a lot of homes and stores, listening to a lot of gear. And have had people over to my place as well. I like good sound. The internet made it easy to meet up with others. But the sheer amount of idiocy and lack of common sense among audiophiles and the woo-selling, moneygrabbing part of the industry drives me nuts. Putting a carpet on the floor or some such will impact the sound much more than all this woo the industry is peddling.   I suppose the most fancy speakers I've heard were a pair of JBL Everest DD67000 a couple of years ago. They sounded okay, but the guy who owned them was into jazz so it was really boring. I have a pair of old Dali Euphonia MS5 speakers hooked up to a a sixties Tandberg tube amp. The amp is not supposed to be able to drive those speakers, but hey, it does and it sounds good. I can't be arsed to get something newer, not until the amp blows up, which I suspect it will do sooner or later.  And to be honest, the vast majority of audiophiles are single, middle-aged boomers with deterioating hearing who get together to listen to different vinyl pressings of the same old boomer rock albums everyone has already heard a million times before, hoping it will sound as fresh and invigorating as it did when they were young and could still get their dicks up without viagra. For added bonus, have 15 000 dollars speakers that are placed in a corner or on a tile floors, but the cables that cost 1000 dollars really makes the sound better.  I wouldnt be this annoyed at all the supremely inplausible and un-scientific audiophile woo if I didnt know those people and how the industry works.",Music

3036,"&gt; Because the problem wasn't as obvious to lawmakers at the time. Technology is constantly changing, and it's only in recent years that the internet has become fast enough for companies like Netflix to emerge and become viable competitors for cable and satellite TV. Even outside of their feud with Netflix, they began throttling peer-to-peer transfer (torrents, online gaming), and began plans to intstitute data caps and allow ""preferred partners"" like The ISP's own video services or large companies that could afford the fee be exempt from them. Basically they started abusing their position more and more.  No. Netflix was throttled in 2012, not in 2015, the difference in technology and internet speeds in 2012 and 2015 is negligible.  &gt;I'd be interested to look this up because it's the first time I've heard this questions, but all I could really do is speculate. My suspicion is that there's more competition and/or less barriers to establish alternate routes if one company started throttling or sabotaging certain connections. It's possible that it's harder for them to get directly between a specific company and it's potential customers or less ability to profit from it.

[KissMeHelga](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ini8t/hey_reddit_who_feels_that_reading_lots_of_books/c255jcs) says it succinctly. It merely brings more from the set of unknowns into the set of knowns. What you do with it is then up to you. If you use it honestly to question all your beliefs/conditioning to try and arrive at some ""objective truth"" it is quite empowering whereas if you pick and choose selectively to only bolster your prior unwarranted beliefs it is quite harmful. Thus ""Intelligence"" has to be applied to what is being ""Read"" so that it itself can grow. The key is to actively seek a variety of thoughts and ideas and apply intelligence to get at the heart of things. One should not lose oneself in the mass of data but must always focus on the essence of the thing under consideration. Read until you are able to grasp the essence and then you may choose to go into the details of various aspects. If done properly, there is a growth of Intelligence else it merely leads to Confusion, ""Analysis Paralysis"" and a loss of Confidence in oneself. ",AskReddit

49309,"**Arkarna**    [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/75c37c7bef574d9d9137fa9ee4668e7e.png)    &gt; The momentum has been building for years, but now the time is finally ripe for Arkarna to emerge with a bang back onto the world's stage.  &gt; Arkarna, An outfit so ahead of their time, that the svengali behind the project, precocious engineering prodigy Ollie Jacobs, has been spending years perfecting his craft, working with the likes with Leftfield (mixing their seminal album Leftism), The Prodigy and Madonna rather than having his own name in lights.  &gt; His band first hit the scene in 1997 with the critically-acclaimed, platinum-selling debut album Fresh Meat, but after touring the world to thousands of fans, Ollie became disillusioned with the way major labels wanted to mould him, so went underground to make the kind of music that satisfied his soul - albeit for other artists.  &gt; Fast-forward a decade, and Ollie finally found a collaborator to meet his exacting creative remit in his quest to re-launch the vision for the band.  &gt; Step forward talented guitarist and songwriter Matt Hart. For the past three years, the pair have hunkered down in their north west London studio and now, they've finally completed the incendiary, ground-breaking album that they know will propel them to the forefront of today's music scene. Yes, Arkarna are back to claim their space on the dancefloor, moshpit and in discerning music lovers' record collections the planet over. No-one else sounds quite like Arkarna.  &gt; When Ollie and Matt first met, it was electric - literally. Ollie, a programmer and singer, who's been a producer at his dad's Queen's Park studio Rollover since he was 14, was on the lookout for someone to take Arkarna's electro-pop sound to the next level.  &gt; Then he met Matt, who left a lasting impression in more ways than one. A smalltown West Sussex boy with a big dream, Matt had studied music classically since his childhood, but recovering from a life-threatening bout of illness aged 15, he started playing rock guitar. Later, while studying a degree in music at the prestigious Goldsmiths University in London, he saw an ad for auditions at Rollover, and, ever ambitious, went for it.  &gt; Matt explains: ""When I went to meet Ollie, I was in a rush, it was chucking down with rain, and I didn't put a bin liner on my amplifier. I tried to mop it down when I got there, but when they plugged me in to play, it gave everyone an electric shock. So before I'd even played, I'd electrocuted half the band, haha.""  &gt; Ollie enthuses: ""When I saw Matt playing, I knew instantly that he had a magic about him that I needed in my creative journey. We ended up working on high end sessions work together, with the likes of Boyzone. But when I started dreaming up some new Arkarna material, Matt was a natural progression so it just developed from that.""  &gt; Now a genuine song-writing partnership, the self-confessed knobtwiddler and balls-out rocker were a marriage made in heaven and the rest will be electrifying history - but year zero is 2010.  &gt; Arkarna have already made global inroads over the past few years, soundtracking Levis ads in the States and, right now, they're the sound of one of the biggest-selling alcoholic drinks in Russia.  &gt; Arkarna's single So Little Time was also the theme tune to Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen's TV show in the US of the same name. On top of that, track House On Fire has featured on legendary US comedy Friends, The OC and the soundtrack for movie Batman And Robin - more importantly, they've even been played on the caff stereo in EastEnders...  &gt; But the past is merely an extra super-powered spring for the turbocharged launchpad that is Arkarna's crowd-pleasing new long player.  &gt; A bold, cerebral but ultimately rump-moving melange of beat-stoked, tune-drenched, emotionally-charged songs, the new album may be seen by some as their comeback, but in many ways, it sees Arkarna wiping the slate clean, whilst not alienating their vast existing fanbase in Southeast Asia and Australia.  &gt; Not only that, the catchy-as-swine-flu debut single from their new album has been mastered by the legendary Chris Gehringer from Sterling Sound, who's recently polished releases from the likes of Yeasayer, Rihanna, La Roux, Keisha and 3Oh!3.  &gt; And that's before you even consider the video, which has been directed by promo geniuses DuckEye, who've previous made videos for the likes of The Fallout Trust, Zero 7, Sigur Ros, and Clayhill - and, without giving too much away, it's set to be a fruity worldwide internet sensation...  &gt; But back to the new album, and with a public appetite voracious for the likes of Pendulum and Muse, Arkarna's unique take on cinematic, BPM-savvy, electronic, stadium-friendly rock with killer melodies is perfectly timed to explode onto the dancefloors, festivals and arenas across the globe - as Matt explains, ""We fall into and cross so many of the genres that are really popular now, but we've still got our own thing going on, we always have. We've got to be true to our sound.""  &gt; Matt elaborates: ""The Arkarna sound is so distinct - no-one sounds like us. We've always thought it was important to incorporate a lot of musical flavours from the old stuff, especially, the dance elements, but time moves on and music progresses, it evolves, so it's important that you evolve with it. And that's what we've done.""  &gt; Ollie adds, pertinently: ""I think it's what naturally comes out and we sound completely different to anyone else - we're not a copy. It's got history behind it, but it's organic and not contrived. And it gets asses on the dancefloor!""  &gt; And what of those lyrics?  &gt; Ollie explains: ""They're just about what's going on inside my head, quite insular. They work on different levels though - I like people to take their own meanings from them. Sometimes they're not meant to make sense. But yes, a lot of them are about love, because it's one of those things you can't help writing about because it hurts like a physical thing sometimes and everyone can relate to it.""  &gt; Matt gives us an extra insight: ""A lot of it is beneath the surface, you can't take them at face value, they're more cerebral and intelligent, you have to read into them. It's not just cliches - they're more arty, less literal, more abstract. But they're all from experience.""  &gt; Preparations are already underway for the Arkarna live onslaught - for which we can only warn you to limber up or face serious injury. As well as a full-on, aural assault with a full live band, Matt and Ollie are also rehearsing their new set acoustically.  &gt; Matt elaborates: ""It will be quite a big surprise the acoustic stuff, as we're making it completely unique. When it sounds as strong as it does acoustically, it's going to blow everyone away with the full band. You can hide behind so much when it's electronic. It's the meaning of the song and the tunes that ultimately carry it and make it a success.""  &gt; But whether you're experiencing them acoustically, with the full-on live experience or via the new album, all we can say is, get ready for the kind of musical therapy that only Arkarna can provide.

32555,"Lets get downvoted...  I grew up just outside an indian reservation. The elementary school I went to was 90% native and I am white. Of those 90% probably half were told every day of their life that the white man is the reason their life sucked. I do not remember a day where I was not fighting 3-4 of them that were 1-2 years older than me. I was ALWAYS bleeding at school for YEARS. School didn't do shit. Right before middle school (when I was the biggest fish in the pond) a group of them came up and started the usual fare of talking shit about white people. Dumbass said I could use my white privilege and swing first, so I grabbed a lunchroom chair and beat him within an inch of his life infront of his friends. I guess they were shocked but eventually a teacher came and pulled the chair (and me still trying to punch the kid) away. I was suspended and the parents tried to sue for medical expences. The judge said the parents didn't have to pay a dime for their kids treatment and my parents had already paid their family enough through taxes (he was super racist...) I was sent to a special needs school since it was my first major offense (and the judge, again, was suuuuuper racist) and from that point on I never had a problem with being bullied. Ended up in a normal high school after moving and slowly realized how abnormal my elementary school experience was. Its hard to feel bad for the kid but after a few years I realized just about the only reason I didn't end up in Juvenile hall was because I was white. Still wish that res would burn to the ground though...  TLDR: Got bullied by natives in elementary school. Beat one with a chair until he was unconscious and my life became infinitely better. Not sure but I think that means it was a fairly toxic environment.",AskReddit

34807,"Dude, don't even think about tier lists. First off, they are mostly opinion (if almost entirely true).  Second, no matter how low a champion is on a tier list, they have their niche in the game (except for Evelynn right now, but that's on purpose)  If you like Pantheon, play him.  I feel he's a ton of fun, and completely unique from any other champion. As a couple of guides from pro players have said recently (Dyrus and Westrice, who both play enough Pantheon to write a guide about him), he is probably hte only champion who can run revive without being made fun of.  In fact, I would even recommend it. Team fight starts, and you die? Revive, and ulti back in there! If done right, that can swing teamfights in your teams favor.  Once the global ulti rework is done, he's only going to get stronger.  Riot admits that they nerfed him too hard, so you're going to see some nice buffs in the coming patches.  Also, since he is not played that often, I find a lot of players aren't familiar wiht how he works.

13716,"I try and prioritize RL as well, so I don't farm nearly as much as I should for legendary chance, but here is what I do and I end up with a legendary every 2-3 weeks:  Emissary quests everyday + 4 Broken Shore dailies so I can guarantee 1 turn in there as well (Order Hall quests can give bonus turn ins over time too) and then the weekly raid with the group.  No LFR, and no additional raids.  Occasionally I'd try and get a M+ of some kind done, though would not always get the highest one.  This does still require about an hour each night to get things done.  A bit more one night (or on the weekend) to do the M+.  If you have additional time on the weekends, it's easy to find a Heroic EN group and blow through that place in 30 minutes just to up your legendary drop chance.  Anything beyond that I would consider overkill for myself, but there are certainly plenty of other things you could do to try and farm those legendaries.  I would agree that there is a bit of a tacit understanding that those who are behind should put in a bit of extra effort  to keep up.  Your DPS numbers are not bad for the content, but our equivalent ilvl DPS are pulling 900k-1mil DPS pretty consistently, so that may have something to do with your guild issues.  I know Ret is very reliant on ideal legendaries, so that may be something you should focus more on, but I completely understand how soul crushing that can be.

He has released over 280 solo studio albums and performed on over 70 more since 1992. He has also made guest appearances on more than 40 different albums by various artists. His music spans such diverse areas as heavy metal, funk, ambient, jazz, electronic, and avant-garde music.  &gt; When performing in his theatrical persona, Buckethead used to wear a KFC bucket (emblazoned with an orange bumper sticker that read “FUNERAL” in black block letters) on his head and a plain white costume mask (commonly found in costume shops and used primarily for dramatic theater productions). More recently, he has switched to a plain white bucket no longer bearing the KFC logo. He also incorporates nunchaku, robot dancing, and toy trading into his stage performances. Buckethead’s persona represents a character who was “raised by chickens” and has made it his “mission in life to alert the world to the ongoing chicken holocaust in fast-food joints around the globe.”  &gt; Although a multi-instrumentalist, Buckethead is best known for his electric guitar playing. He has been voted number 8 on a list in GuitarOne magazine of the “Top 20 Greatest Guitar Shredders of All Time.”  &gt; Buckethead performs primarily as a solo artist. He has collaborated with a wide variety of high profile artists such as Les Claypool, Tony Williams, Bootsy Collins, Bernie Worrell, Iggy Pop, Serj Tankian, Guns N’ Roses, Saul Williams, Mike Patton, Viggo Mortensen, and with Bill Laswell in Praxis. Buckethead has also written and performed music for major motion pictures, including: Saw II, Ghosts of Mars, Beverly Hills Ninja, Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat: Annihilation and Last Action Hero.

People already lose their families and livelihoods. Whole cultures are already being destroyed. And a country on the verge of default who takes on short term cash injections is starting their economic development from the negatives, while at the same time keeping the same leadership that got them there.

We care more about keeping Conte content with Chelsea than anything else.  This is my issue if the transfer window rumour cycle started with Chelsea after Morata/Belotti (my choices all this time) and United after Lukaku I would be a bit chilled, upset that United are getting a potentially great striker but not like they were not gonna go for one anyway but at least our targets were still within reach. But it didn't happen that way, Chelsea wanted Lukaku, Conte really wanted Lukaku which meant he had plans for him that he wanted to implement thus I obviously wanted Conte to get him but now he has to settle for second or third choice. So I'm upset Conte didn't get who he wanted and upset that Chelsea didn't even try much to get lukaku. I'm pretty sure Chelsea only bid on Lukaku after United did.

Such a debate as this would never have happened in the US, at least the US I left in 2005 to become a Canadian (my family became Canadian citizens in 2012).  This has always been far more than a simple question of Omar Khadr's rights as a citizen, or his rights as a human being under international law.  This has been a test of the Canadian principles which underpin those rights, and whether or not those Canadians will uphold and defend those principles.  Khadr is a Canadian citizen.  He always has been.  What does that mean? Traditionally, that has meant that Khadr would be brought before a judge, formally presented with the crimes against him, granted access to competent legal council and permitted to defend himself against those charges.  Instead, Khadr was denied those rights, and he was tortured by the Americans, with his government's consent.    Canadians have been debating whether they will have the courage to stand by our principles, when those principles are challenged ... or whether we'll abandon them easily, without resistance. For the sake of expediency. Out of fear.   We defend our own rights, liberties, and dignity whenever we protect those who we may not even feel deserve them, especially those who are powerless to defend themselves.  That's Canadian.

Then Peyton joined in. And Eli sort of sheepishly went along with it.  The problem for San Diego isn't that the Manning family argued against San Diego, the problem is that they *told the truth about the organisation*, which is that it's not a very good one. The Mannings extracted a pound of flesh from AJ Smith and the Spanos family. If they were going to have their prodigal son drafted, the Mannings were going to air all of the Chargers dirty laundry.  Do the Chargers fans care? No. Because they don't believe there's anything wrong. But you know who does care? Other players and their agents. Other teams and their GMs. You don't talk about the problems of other teams openly when you're a Manning. But they did. And they didn't damage the reputation of the Chargers - they did it on their own; they confirmed to other people in the NFL that it's not a team worth doing business with.  The fans think whatever they think of the Chargers. Good payroll, seem to be there, blah blah. But the people in the league were empowered to stand up to the Chargers. You saw Vincent Jackson do it. Marcus McNeill did it. Acrimony. It's not a nice destination for free agents if there's a reputation of having to deal with bullshit. The team has been forcing the city to give it handouts for decades now and threatening to move. The team, under the past 3 GMs, the latter two who are totally different than Bobby Beathard have had problems attracting free agents and retaining players.  The Mannings said what everyone whispered in private. San Diego is a bad place to play. But AJ Smith confirmed it. Now you see acrimony. The Chargers may be messed up, but you don't do that to them when you're the Mannings. You just don't.",nfl

11395,"Been awhile since I read the book, so may not be 100% on the details, forgive me.  SPOILERS if you haven't read/seen Inferno.  The characters spend the story tracking down this contagion that a mad scientist is trying to unleash on the world as a population control measure.  Mystery ensues, blah blah blah, we get to the end; they figure the location where the bad guy is releasing this contagion and make their way there.  The dude put a gallon of this virus/bacteria/whatever into a dissolving plastic bag in an underground cistern.  He videotapes this bag that is set to dissolve and release the toxin in a week (or whatever), infecting humanity, etc etc.    In the book, they find the location supposedly just in time to prevent the bag bursting.  Tension builds as they look for it, and finally they do. The twist is that they found just an empty bag; the contagion had already been released and infecting people (unknown to anyone) for days. The end result is that the infection spreads around the world, and makes 1/3 of humans infertile (rather than outright killing people); thus accomplishing the scientist's goal of reducing the population.  It was a great if somewhat dark ending to the book.  In the movie however, they Hollywood-ize it to where it doesn't even make the same point (that overpopulation is actually a bad thing, the 'mad' scientist guy was right).  They arrive to find the bag still intact (of course), and contain it (of course), thus saving humanity (of course) from just another insane mass murderer.  Completely missing the point.  If you ever saw 'I am Legend' (Will Smith with dog and zombies, 2007-ish), it had a similar so-called ""controversial"" alternate ending to the movie that humanized the zombies and made an interesting ending.  This was removed from the final version (of course), instead showing the zombies as vile evil monsters (of course), and the survivors escaping and saving humanity (of course).

Don't get me wrong the raids are great, but the amount of effort you have to put in to stay up to date is awful.  For example, I'm in a mythic guild that's 4/9 mythic rn, gonna be 5/9 on monday (Lol desolate host is a joke). I'm playing a DH, but I still don't have anger of the half giants. So I have to run every single old raid, every single LFR, and spam M+ until I can get anger of the half giants. The other 2 demon hunters in the guild still have anger of the half giants, so it's difficult to compete. They simply have more fury to work with than me.  So guess who gets sat on fights where we have too many melee or say my class isn't good on?

50005,"The Knicks continue to stall a trade from happening, the worst they will come out of this.   First off, they are in this situation because of their own doing. They gave Melo his NTC and trade kicker. They spent the last year or so completely trashing Melo in the media, trying tempt him to waive his NTC. They were the ones saying that they are ""motivated"" to move Melo and now they are chickening out.   Even though most of the trashing of Melo was Phil's doing, the Knicks' higher ups and Dolan did not do anything to stop it or even show Melo some support.   Now as they continue to stall in a trade, they are stuck because Melo still has his NTC that he is only willing to waive for 2 teams and his trade value is only going to decrease at this point.   Holding on to Melo is something that they can do but they'll look even more pathetic around the league, especially if Melo continues to voice his displeasure. Melo is still one of the most connected/well liked players in the league with almost every big name star and agent close with him. The message of how incompetent the Knicks are treating their star player won't go unnoticed in this league.   Having Melo there for even a season will cause a constant distraction for the Knicks that no team wants.   The Knicks are hoping Melo will opt out next year but that's no guarantee.  As a 34 year old, he could go the D-Wade route and opt in. He'll have almost 28M reasons to opt in.  Do they really want to waste 2 seasons of this?    Finally, they are risking alienating their franchise cornerstone to be, Porzingis. He didn't go to his exit meeting in support of Melo and it looks like he is avoiding the Knicks at all cost this offseason, even after the firing of Phil. That's definitely not a good look and very telling that he will probably bounce the first chance he gets unless something changes.   I get the Knicks want at least something good in return for Melo but they have completely fumbled this whole situation and are looking even more incompetent with each passing day.  People around the NBA are taking note. Not saying the should straight up trade Melo for Anderson but if there's a deal on the table that they can feel at least a little bit tolerable, they need to jump on it and finish this correctly. The longer they wait, the less likely they'll get anything tolerable. ",nba

They want to play a melee spec, not a ranged. Oh and survival hunters because they still exist.  &gt;Then you have DK's/Enhancement shamans who do similar damage to rets, maybe 45k-80k more ST according to WCL Mythic Goroth at Max Percentile, but have far less utility and no immunity, which is obviously super important this tier.  &gt;When you take all that stuff into consideration, rets are actually the 3rd best melee DPS, only to be outdone by warriors and rogues, that both just got nerfed.

Also, our ret was slotted for our mistress progress kill when I wasn't and would have been in for maiden too if he wasn't sick because tanks deaths are a thing on that fight, kings can be helpful, and rets do a ton more damage when they stack their damage CD's with the maiden buffs than most other melee classes.  &gt;TLDR: Ret's aren't really that bad.  &gt;Edit: Forgot about Havoc, but Havoc isn't very good either. They only really shine on maiden because they just hold their burst CD's for when they have the maiden buff and do insane damage.

36948,"Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is preparing to wait out his contract and leave Arsenal on a free transfer next summer, after rejecting a take-it-or-leave-it offer from the club.  The young England attacker was offered a significant wage increase to extend his deal at the Emirates but declined - because his priority is playing time, rather than improving his terms.  Liverpool were rebuffed when they made a direct approach to Arsenal to discuss Oxlade-Chamberlain’s availability, earlier this week, leaving all parties at an impasse. Oxlade-Chamberlain is attracted by the idea of playing for Jurgen Klopp, given Klopp’s record with developing the attacking gifts of players such as Adam Lallana, Gini Wijnaldum and Sadio Mane.  At 23, he is most eager to nail down a regular role in a top team and start games consistently – something that has not quite happened at Arsenal, despite six seasons there. Though Arsene Wenger has said Oxlade-Chamberlain figures prominently in his plans, experience has made the player cautious regarding promises about a starting role.  Oxlade-Chamberlain is determined to be in England’s squad for next summer’s World Cup, but is prepared to run down his contract – which expires in 2018 – even if that means being jettisoned from Arsenal’s team.   Arsenal are believed to value Oxlade-Chamberlain at £25m, despite the limited time left on his deal. Since joining from Southampton, for an initial £12m in 2011, Oxlade-Chamberlain has scored 20 times in 194 games for the Gunners, winning 27 England caps.  The impasse over a valued talent is yet another thing to deal with at a busy time for Arsenal, who are close to agreement with Lyon over Alexandre Lacazette after indicating they are willing to break their club record of £42.4m to sign the prolific French striker.  They are embroiled in sagas with Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez over contract extensions.

37494,"Love Live! S1EP11: The Greatest Live Performance  Greetings Comrades and fellow Denizens of the Wired, I hope that you have been enjoying all of the fluff and fun times, because it's time to get ready for the TOURNAMENT ARC! [Love Live!](/s ""AND DRAMA AND SADNESS!"") We're about to get serious now Comrades, so without further ado, let's get to it! Warning, Love Live! and Gundam Build Fighters Try spoilers below, enjoy!  Before we begin this episode, we must address our recap, brought to us by the glorious Nico! She even graces us with the powerful Nico Nico Nii as she delivers a wonderful introduction. Oh, wait, she was supposed to recap the beach episode wasn't she? Hold on a second, some foul heretic slandered Nico by claiming she was ""lame,"" Nico even said so in the episode, this must be the work of an enemy stand! But before going into that, let's move on to the episode.  We see Honoka departing for school, introducing herself as if it were the first episode of a series. Also, it appears that Japan's phenomenon of declining birth rates is canon for the series' universe, which makes thing interesting given [Gundam Build Fighters Try](/s ""the links that Love Live! has with Gundam Build Fighters Try, given that Otonokizaka Academy is one of the participants in the series."")  Also, we see that μ's has had some great success recently, as they somehow jumped from rank 50 to rank 19, more than enough to qualify for the TOURNAMENT ARC! I must say that even having seen this before, I am still surprised as to the massive jump. I mean, the beach episode was great and all, but was that all it took to jump the ranks that much? Guess the fans like the fanservice.  Anyways, Honoka informs the bird and Umi of the good news, before screaming out a title drop for the heavens. Honoka's classmates are also pleased to hear of the good news, and are shocked at Honoka's informal greeting with Eli. Honoka then explains the plot of the last episode to the trio.  As the trio wisely try to get autographs before the final push for stardom, we see one of the candidates for world's smallest signature, courtesy of Umi. Honoka, noticing this, writes one of the largest signatures I've seen so far, so big in fact that she partially ran out of room.  Additionally, it appears that the glorious Nico is off duty at the moment, which I still am surprised over. If she gushed so much over her merch, you'd think she'd be overjoyed at giving out autographs, but I digress.  Honoka then notices that the bird is missing, and we cut away to the bird, who is pensively staring at the ominous letter we saw a few episodes ago. We then move on to Serval and Honoka gushing over the stage they are to perform on. Nico criticizes her backup dancers' swooning, until she too is overcome by emotions and squee.  Eli and Nozomi arrive to inform the baka trio that they can't rest yet, as there are still two weeks to go, and every school idol group is giving it their all for the final push. As Nico declares her readiness to do whatever is needed, Eli decided to assign Nico... the grand task of participating in a lottery.  Undeterred, Nico takes this in stride and dramatically turns the handle. As everyone goes into slo-mo and waits in anticipation, sans Nozomi who does her typical mystical stuff, we get the dramatic result of... complete and utter failure.  Clearly we had interference, someone rigged the lottery, it must be the heretic from earlier, OR AN ENEMY STAND! But, moving on to the failure of μ's to secure the use of the auditorium. Meanwhile, it appears that the morale of Nico's backup dancers has completely broken, with even Nozomi in shock, oh the humanity! She isn't even Washi-Washing people, NANI!  The members of μ's panic on the rooftop, sans the unflappable Maki, with even Nozomi broken from the experience. Eli then tries to smooth things over by suggesting that μ's practice somewhere else. Nico suggesting using the club room, after all, they got that expansion recently, but Honoka claims that it still is too cramped.  Then, Honoka comes up with a (bad) idea to practice in the more cramped area of the hallway. Nico rightly notes that they'd all look like idiots if they did that. After a bit of arguing Honoka comes up with the idea of practicing on the roof.  Honoka then proposes that, in order to attract people to the roof, that they merely sing very loud. As Honoka and the bird walk home, the bird seems preoccupied with something. After a bit of mumbling, the bird states that they should all give it all they've got.  We then see the bird and her mom discussing something seriously important, to which the bird is to make the final decision on. Honoka's suggestion for the performance is a new song of Maki's, to which all the members swear to work hard on to ensure that they are ready for the performance. As Honoka is to be the center, she is told by Eli to work twice as hard to ensure peak performance.  Honoka interprets this to mean night training, to which her sister warns of her to be careful, right as admission information to Otonokizaka can be seen under her homework. We then see a lovely poster for the upcoming concert, with Nico rightly in the front, and Serval rightly with a cat-like expression on her face.  As the bird attempts to speak with Honoka again, Honoka runs off to tell everyone in the class about the concert. Honoka appears to be working overtime, as she came up with new dance moves, which raises feelings of apprehension amongst the group, except for the acquiescence of the bird.  Umi tells Honoka that she should take it easy, Honoka responds by ignoring this advice. Umi attempts to get the bird to help, but the bird sides with Honoka. Later, we see Honoka sneezing as she's on the phone, it's probably nothing right? [Love Live!](/s ""IT'S NOT!"")  Honoka thinks that the bird is not acting any differently, before sneezing again. As Umi tells Honoka to NOT get sick and take the night off, Honoka decides to ignore the sane member of her year and go off training again... IN THE RAIN!  Please excuse me for a second while I smash my head into my workdesk.  Ow, well, now that that's out of the way, Umi gets a call from the bird, as the bird has some important plot stuff to say. Hm... I wonder what this could be...  After Honoka's night of training, her mom wakes her up, scolding Honoka for not waking up earlier for the cultural festival. Honoka's response is to sneeze again, with blurred vision to boot, before collapsing. With a look of shock, she feels her throat, before we cut to Serval and Hanayo noting the pouring rain at the roof.  Meanwhile, while Nico is getting excited, Umi and the bird are discussing something serious. Honoka shows up late and unprepared, before stumbling into the bird. Eli claims Honoka's voice sounds strange, to which Honoka claims she can just take a cough drop.  The trio of colleagues are busy advertising the concert, the members of μ's note that the rain isn't letting up. Honoka states that they should perform anyway, as they of μ's do not give up. Amidst the rain, the members of μ's prepare to start, with Eli and Honoka's sisters in the audience as well.  We then move on to a rocking performance from the great members of μ's, surely nothing can go wrong right?  WRONG! After the great performance, Honoka keels over from the deadly Japanese Cold! EGADS! I know Sunrise made this show and all, but who let crazy ol' Kill 'em All Tomino in to guest write? Oh wait, she JUST has a fever, and you know, has collapsed from utter exhaustion.  THIS IS STILL NOT GOOD, NOT ACCORDING TO KEIKAKU!  [](#notaccordingtokeikaku)  As Honoka is sprawled out in the rain, all she can mumble is for the next song, to which the bird wails in sadness.  [](#everythingisfine)  Well, that was certainly a way to end an episode. I've seen it all before and I'm still at a loss for words. See you all on the next thread, and until then, farewell, now, if you'll excuse me.  [](#trynottocry)  (Curls up into a ball and sobs in a corner.)",anime
32223,"**Buzzcocks**    [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/8d1605ba4f6546b6bb1d6b217ce9ca44.png)    &gt; Buzzcocks are an English punk rock band formed in Bolton, Greater Manchester, UK in 1976, led by singer-songwriter and guitarist Pete Shelley for nearly their entire existence.  &gt; They are commonly regarded as an important influence on the Manchester music scene, the independent record label movement and the punk rock, power pop, pop punk and indie rock genres in general. They are primarily remembered for their singles, a string of would-be hits that combined a strong grasp of pop song craftsmanship with rapid-fire punk energy. These singles were collected on Singles Going Steady, described by critic Ned Raggett as a ""punk masterpiece"" The widely covered ""Ever Fallen in Love?"" remains one of their best-known songs.  &gt; The name ""Buzzcocks"" partially comes from the Manchester slang term cock meaning youngster, and its use in the 1970s ITV drama serial Rock Follies which included the catch phrases ""that's the buzz, cocks"" and ""give me a buzz, cock!""  &gt; Buzzcocks were one of the key first generation British punk rock bands to form in the wake of the Sex Pistols in 1976. They were founded by Mancunians Pete Shelley and Howard Devoto, however Devoto left soon after the group released their Spiral Scratch EP (on their own independent label), leaving Shelley to take over vocals.   &gt; They are best known for their catchy, poppy punk sound, which has been widely influential, which was adopted as Peter Shelley took over on the vocals, singing about what the whole punk rock scene opted not to sing about: love. Devoto in the meanwhile formed Magazine.  &gt; They rehearsed in a friend's kitchen and played at the all-day 100 club punk ""festival"", in London. At the end of 1977 the band signed to United Artists and released ""Orgasm Addict"", with Shelley's high-pitched vocal delivery and Ramones-esque fuzz-guitar sound ensuring the controversial single would be played over again. Later came ""What Do I Get?"" which hit the UK charts and showed Shelley's brilliance in songwriting.  &gt; An LP was then released, Another Music in a Different Kitchen which came with its own carrier bag, labelled ""Product"". In 1978-79 five chart-hitting singles were released including ""Ever Fallen in Love?"" and had captured a pop-loving audience by this time. Love Bites, their second LP was released later on, which had less excitement than the last album, though it did sell well, with Steve Diggle taking over lyric-writing.  &gt; October 1979 saw A Different Kind of Tension which was panned by some critics, quite unfairly, as it contains some excellent songs, the title track being the stand-out. It perhaps suffered from being the second album to be released that year, with the record company keen to capitalise on the band's chart success at the time.   &gt; 3 more singles followed in 1980, but the spark had clearly gone out for a while. Musical differences and the long slog behind them led to the band splitting in early 1981. Pete Shelley embarked in a solo career..   &gt; He released three dance/electronic influenced solo albums: Homosapien, XL1 and Heaven and The Sea - all with the same fine songwriting skills. Meanwhile, Steve Diggle formed Flag of Convenience - a power pop combo -  and toured with some success.   &gt; A 5 album/CD set was released in 1989 called Product, which contained all the albums to date, plus the greatest hits and B sides album, Singles Going Steady, and the last non-album singles, Why She's A Girl From the Chainstore, Airwaves Dream and Running Free, plus the B sides  &gt; In 1992 the Buzzcocks reformed, without original drummer John Maher and bassist Steve Garvey, and releasd Trade Test Transmissions in 1993, quite different from their earlier material, with nods to the power pop scene popular at the time. All Set in 1996 saw a return to form with familiar riffs and pin sharp lyrics pop-punk. Next year Chronology was released, the missing album, including outtakes from the three United Artists albums.  In 1999 they released Modern, which saw Shelley in reflective mode and Steve Diggle taking over more of the vocal duties.  &gt; Then followed another brief break in 2000, with Shelley teaming up with old band-mate Howard Devoto to release a largely disappointing album, Buzzkunst. Compilations followed, including Inventory in 2003, which contained every single to date, and 30 in 2005 to celebrate 30 years performing  &gt; 2005 saw the Buzzcocks back touring and in 2007 they released the superb Flat Pack Philosophy, widely agreed to rank up with the best of Buzzcocks output  &gt; 2008/9 saw a short tour where the band played tracks from Another Music and Love Bites.  &gt; The Buzzcocks continue to be a huge influence on many bands and are still enjoyed by a large, and very loyal, fanbase.

Two-thirds of slaves were native.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_Canada_(New_France)#Enslavement_of_indigenous_people_by_whites  http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/slavery-of-indigenous-people-in-canada/  http://www.historymuseum.ca/virtual-museum-of-new-france/population/slavery/  *""The Aboriginal population of Canada during the late 15th century is estimated to have been between 200,000[10] and two million,[11] with a figure of 500,000 currently accepted by Canada's Royal Commission on Aboriginal Health.[12] Repeated outbreaks of Old World infectious diseases such as influenza, measles and smallpox (to which they had no natural immunity), were the main cause of depopulation. This combined with other factors such as dispossession from European/Canadian settlements and numerous violent conflicts resulted in a forty- to eighty-percent aboriginal population decrease after contact.[10] For example, during the late 1630s, smallpox killed over half of the Wyandot (Huron), who controlled most of the early North American fur trade in what became Canada.

While this tier still getting sorted, its looking like we are the go to for stacked damage recovery moreso than other classes thanks to 4 piece. Which is a first.

Combined with htt, AG, weapon and velens complimenting them all. We carry CDs to deal with more mechanics than any other healer. That is our strength. Not mastery. Mastery is just part of the deal.

Joey DeMaio was a bass/pyro technician for Black Sabbath, who were playing a show in England at the time, and Ross the Boss was the guitarist of a band called Shakin' Street. The whole thing started when the two locked themselves in a locker room to find out which one could play the guitar harder and faster.  &gt; After agreeing that they would found a band, the two took in Eric Adams, the ""man with lungs of leather"", as their vocalist, and Donny Hamzik as their drummer. They released their first album, ""Battle Hymns"", with this lineup in 1982. On their second release, ""Into Glory Ride"" (1983), Scott Columbus was introduced as their new drummer, along with his custom made stainless steel drums (regular ones would not endure his aggressive style).  The contract for Into Glory Ride was also signed in the band's own blood.   &gt; Manowar's third album, Hail to England (1984), started a tour in Great Britain. However, the band were fed up with their current record company's dominant nature, and released yet another record during the same year; ""Sign of the Hammer"" was published by 10 Records - hence the song ""All Men Play on 10"" included on this album.  &gt; In the beginning of 1987, ""Fighting the World"" was released, featuring hit songs such as ""Fighting the World"", ""Black Wind, Fire and Steel"" and ""Defender"". Followed by a tour in Europe, ""Fighting the World"" was a success.  &gt; Their next album, ""Kings of Metal"" (1988), was widely dedicated to the fans of Manowar all around the world, as can be told by looking at the cover (plenty of different flags scattered around). This album also featured recordings with a large male choir, such as ""Blood of the Kings"" and ""The Crown and the Ring (Lament of the Kings)"". The title of this album is the reason that their fans (and also themselves) dub them ""The Kings of Metal"".  &gt; Not being pleased by his career with Manowar, Ross the Boss quit the band at this point, and was replaced by David Shankle. Also, the drummer known as ""Rhino"" took Scott Columbus's place on Manowar's next release, ""The Triumph of Steel"" published in 1992. After finishing their ""Secrets of Steel"" tour, they were voted as the band that fans would most like to see in Russia, beating out Beatles and Michael Jackson.  &gt; 1996 saw the release of ""Louder than Hell"", with Scott Columbus back in the drums and a new talent, Karl Logan, in lead guitar. This album included hit tracks ""Gods Made Heavy Metal"", ""The Power"", ""Brothers of Metal (Pt.1)"" and ""Return of the Warlord"".  &gt; After some more touring and the change of millennium, ""Warriors of the World"" was released in 2002, featuring tracks ""Warriors of the World (United)"" and one dedicated to Italian fans, ""Nessun Dorma"", which was earlier performed by Eric Adams on their show in Italy.  &gt; Manowar has also released six live-DVD's, ""Hell on Earth"" Parts I-V and ""The Day the Earth Shook - The Absolute Power"", with the unbelivable event of the 2005 Earthshaker festival.  A new EP called ""Sons of Odin"" was released in October 2006.  Their latest album was released at the end of February - beginning of March 2007, entitled ""Gods Of War"".  &gt; Also in 2007 Manowar started their own metalfest in Bad Arolsen, Germany, which is called the Magic Circle Festival.  &gt; In August 2008 Manowar released an one-song single,  'Die With Honor'. The song was also edited for the latest ""Thunder in the sky"" EP, part of ""The Asgard Saga"" forthcoming CD. The EP included the song ""Father"" recorded in 15 more languages other than English-another tribute of the band to their faithful fans all around the world!  &gt; Official website: http://www.manowar.com Official Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/manowar Official Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/manowar Official myspace http://www.myspace.com/manowarofficial  Read more on Last.fm.

16091,"As barwin said, slugging percentage is awful. Besides Kemp, they are essentially a team of singles hitters. The runners for the most part move station to station. They also hit into a lot of double plays, so they often get 2 hits and a walk in an inning and don't score a single run. Their average with runners in scoring position is also terrible. This is why they might get a lot of hits in a game but only score a few runs.  Other times, they simply can't get on base, like today where they had 3 hits for the whole game. They have a few guys who are regular starters that are batting in the low .200s.   To compound the problem, this lack of runs takes its toll on the pitching, which is the team's only saving grace. It is way easier to pitch with a lead because you can go after the hitters by throwing strikes and getting ahead in the count. The starting pitchers know they have little room for error because if they give up more than 2 runs, it is most likely going to result in a loss for the Dodgers.

Why is it then that in other parts of the world, where gas costs more, they are capable of paying their staff properly. Am I missing something here? Do these places just need to hire less terrible managers or what? Does the food cost 3x as much in other countries or is it because of portion size?

What's more, let's say you're on Plan X and it's for 100Mb down/30 Mb up (or whatever), with 300GB bandwidth for $50 a month (this is all made up), and they come out with a new suite of plans where the closest to you is, say, 100 down/30 up, 350GB for $40/mo, they'll automatically move you over to that.  Basically, they'll automatically adjust your plan, so long as the new setup is a better value for you. Never in the other direction - always to your advantage. They'll just let you know after it's done, and charge you the new (almost always far lower) rate.  Also, I forget the exact times, but in the dead of night your usage doesn't count towards your bandwidth limit. So, schedule any big transfers (updates, off-site backups, torrents, etc.) to run during those hours, and it's ""free"".",canada

60173,"Several glaring issues with the video.      First of which, he invents an entirely new system which could (not really) work, but provides no supporting evidence as to why the current accepted theory is false.      Second, his system has some pretty big issues, first of which is his magical extremely powerful magnetic field which would be required to curve that much gas. That would play hell with all navigational equipment, even the humble compass would be rendered useless.       He also doesn't seem to understand atmospheric refraction, which has been well tested and well proven which is why the sun disappears rapidly and before the light goes away. That's explained much better with a round Earth than the single brightest light source magically becoming invisible because it moved too far away.      Could a massively powerful magnet passing through the sky excite neon to create a color spectrum as seen at sunset? Maybe. Could it be done without wreaking havock on electrical and navigation systems? Absolutely not.      Pilots have to reset their plane's gyroscopes every 100 miles or so to maintain an accurate reading. Why is this?      A large pendulum in a vacuum can be used as a clock by placing 24 ticks in a circle around the point. Why?      I have personally experienced the Coriolis effect, I missed every time I didn't account for it. Why?      The planets we observe follow a gravitational model which has yet to be proven wrong and requires the sun be as massive as observed, not magically tiny and close. Why?      We can observe moons moving around Jupiter as it is a spherical object. I can see the moon is spherical with a 30$ pair of binoculars. Why are they spherical but the Earth magically flat?      And finally, my favorite point to bring up, are you able to provide a 2D map of the earth which accurately predicts the distance between any two points?      A global model can do this. Therefore, you have 3 options.      A) Disprove the mathematical proof Theorema Egregium which says there is no possible way to map a 3D object perfectly to a 2D plane of the object.      B) Find an inconsistency in a distance provided by the global model      C) Prove that the Earth is an infinite flat plane which would allow a 3D model to be perfectly mapped on a 2D plane.      Do any of those and you're about ready for a nobel prize. This is one area where you can't magic in an answer like saying ""Oh, well the sun is actually much smaller and way closer. Nah, I don't have any evidence but I'm pretty sure it's true."" This requires actual mathematical proof or evidence of an inconsistency.",conspiracy

Nope.  We're no more lazy than TFW's.  We're just more able to stick up for our labour rights, whereas TFW's are more likely to suck it up and do the job for pitiful earnings because it's even more dire for them at home.

How someone acts or what role they adopt in society is based on us grouping together and deciding males (with testicles and penises) tend to be physically stronger (hence why we don't have cross gender sports) than females (vagina and ovaries).

Conspiracy related: Our medical system is broken. Symptoms are ""treated"" with pharmaceuticals while most underlying causes *other than obvious traumas or physical anomalies* remain in the dark.   I have spent more than half my life struggling with back and joint issues, and all that severe chronic pain subsequently adds to the mix. I've had enough xrays to heat a hotpocket. I've had (full spine, and main joint) MRIs that show little evidence of physical anomalies. (*Granted, they seemed to be rather low-res broad scans and could be missing something.*)  I have tried increased exercise, diets, supplements, neuro meds, SSRIs, etc. and the *only* thing that has alleviated most of my disabling pain is atypically high doses of opiates. While they allow me to maintain basic physical activities, and provide periods of clear thought to navigate the never ending challenges in my healthcare and plight for subsistence assistance, my life has become a hellish prison.   Sensing that I am likely not the only person facing such challenges, I honestly feel like I and my physicians are missing something.

60196," /u/ryarger really hit the nail on the head when he identified that this is not a ""study"" in any sense of the word, and is just a collection of debunked hoaxing blog stuff and not even from climate scientists. Peer reviewd? By whom? Published? Note that there's no publication information here. It's a document created by non-scientists who apparently know how to ""print to PDF"" but what's interesting is that it's nearly identical to a [skeptic's blog](http://archive.is/V5Hgp) by [Ole Humlum a guy debunked numerous times](https://skepticalscience.com/humlum-at-it-again.html)  Having debated OP before - we see again the typical pattern of posting stuff that's not gone through any scientific peer review, or fact-checking, etc. on these blog sites what you find is that there's a scary title and leading paragraph but then a mish-mash of unscientific stuff below that represents the gish gallop. It fools those who don't read more than the titles of things.  But to really put this away as a Gish Gallop we can take a look at a random sample of the stuff to see if it passes scientific muster. So I looked at the report and I found something very interesting.   1) Let's look at a chart from the [""Bombshell"" ""Study""](https://thsresearch.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/ef-gast-data-research-report-062717.pdf) on the percent days of temperatures over 95 F. http://imgur.com/TVOp1D5. I've debated /u/timo1200 before on this chart and pointed out to him that this is bogus because the data is unsourced (where exactly did they get this from?), and the number of devices have been reduced over the years, and many have been moved, and many are now in remote locations in places like Alaska. But having discussed this with /u/timo1200 before - I know where this chart came from. It came from Tony Heller's blog and ... read on  2) Let's look at Tony Heller's version http://imgur.com/EmrFGk8 . [[Source](http://archive.is/zGIFO)] Notice a few things: 1) The charts are identical but Heller's says it is from only 1192 stations. When I debated this before I raised the point ... hey - which stations are they? Just remote ones? Silence was the reply. Look at #1 above. It says ""ALL stations"" but then ... why are the graphs IDENTICAL?   3) Let's put #1 above #2 and make it slightly transparent and scale it to match ... http://imgur.com/cbdbfgE   The charts are identical but suddenly it's gone from ""1192 stations"" to ""all stations."" It's gone from 9% to 4%. And all that ... with NO change in the actual graph.  http://imgur.com/a/vLQNI  And so in all of the above - one asks - where's the link to the original data used? What's the methodology for generating those two identical graphs with widely different Y-axes?  http://imgur.com/a/vLQNI.   I would guess that when you get two identical graphs but completely different Y-axis that this is either incompetence or fraud. But because NONE of these sites actually disclose the actual data used to create the graphs - I would lean toward guessing that they are just making stuff up.   So .... not just a gish gallop. But made up charts as well to try to fake a point. Sad at best and dishonest at worst. ",conspiracy

50665,"&gt;You know, we have always assumed both Jon and Dany would be ""Good Guys"" on the same side. It's entirely possible that Dany ends up a villain still, though. It would be an incredible twist, but an entirely possible one nonetheless. It would be easy to do, too: have Dany lose a few battles, and decide to torch King's Landing with her dragons as the only way to get the throne.  888  &gt;I think it's almost inevitable at this point. Her visions in season 2 had her at a barren, snow covered iron throne, there's been multiple glimpses of a dragon flying over king's landing, multiple references to 'ruling the ashes'. There's no way to reconcile the fact that the Dothraki only value strength through rape and pillage. At the very least we're going to come to a point where Dany realizes she can't have her cake and eat it too. Whatever she does from that point will dictate how the series ends.  I think it's far more likely Cersei sets off the rest of the Wildfire, leaving nothing left for Dany to rule, hence her vision and in it her walking away from the throne to join the fight at the wall.

38423,"Yeah I get that, but that's what I'm talking about, climbing you hidden MMR faster than your real one is a trick to push your win rate down and stop you climbing too fast. You're games are getting harder before you've climbed to the rank, so eventually you're gonna hit that point of a loss streak and balance that win rate out.   Then again, I guess the only difference would be if they didn't do that would be climbing to the same rank anyway - you just get the visible MMR /SR for it, before you start getting super tough games and losing.  If they both climbed at the same rate, you'd climb much faster because your games get harder equivalent to how much you climb, as it is if you get a good winstreak the system goes 'woah woah woah slow down bud', and sticks a few people higher skill than you on each team to try and get you to fuck up. Obviously if you persevere, you keep climbing, but it's a bit unfair IMO. I'm never a fan of this 'you have to beat people above your rank just to get your rank' systems. League does a simillar thing. Get your silver promos with a 70% win rate? 'enjoy playing with 3 gold ranked players on the enemy team sucker.

It's more about self-respect than happiness. If you have problems you're ignoring because you think the ""right person"" coming into your life will fix everything, then you're not taking care of yourself, you're not fulfilling your own needs.

7836,"Driving safely requires processing a shitton of information. The more you do it, the better your brain gets at automating parts of that processing, like tracking your speed or the locations of cars around you, but when you first start driving you have to do that all manually, you probably literally cannot track everything you should be, even if you feel like you can, and even with lots of experience it won't be effortless and you will still be taxing your resources pretty heavily when you drive. In light of that fact, you should be always seek to minimize distractions, this is incredibly important for your first few thousand hours behind the wheel, but really you should try to reduce distractions while driving until the day you die. So...  1. Don't talk on the phone, even with a hands-free device, unless it is truly an emergency - the person on the other end doesn't know what is going on around you so they don't know when to shut the fuck up and let you think, and if they are talking they are tying up resource you might need to avoid death or injury.  2. Don't take your eyes off the road for any longer than you absolutely have to. That means that when you check your blind spot, you do it fast, it means you don't fiddle with the radio unless you are at a dead stop and even then do it as fast as possible and get your eyes back on the road and your mirrors.  3. If you are impaired in *any way*, avoid driving if at all possible. Obviously this means don't drive drunk, but it also means don't drive angry if you can avoid it, don't drive tired (seriously, don't drive tired. You drive about as well after being awake for 24 hours as you do after chugging a beer. Make it 30 hours and you are up to multiple beers) don't drive if you are in significant pain if you can avoid it, etc. Call a cab if you have to, try to adjust your schedule to make sure it doesn't happen often, etc.  4. If you are a new driver, any time you *aren't* driving you should be practicing the more passive parts of driving. Keep track of where cars around you are (you'll be surprised, your brain can keep track of things that pass in and out of view very well with practice. You should eventually be able to identify the location of every car within 20 feet of you in any direction without checking mirrors, just based on where they were when you last saw them in a mirror and how fast they appeared to be going. You should never *assume* that you are correct, but you should always be tracking.)",AskReddit

And most patients aren't getting treatment for that long. They have it for a few weeks or couple months then have to pause because it damages the body too much. A lot of the time, patients either beat the cancer or die within a few years. Sometimes it comes back, but not always.   I don't think this idea that treatment is some long term way of milking patients holds up to the reality of cancer treatments. I would wager their is way more money in a cure, and whoever finds it first makes themselves and their entire family line rich indefinitely. Furthermore, the theory always assumes a cure would be some one time pill, but very few illnesses are cured that way.

39020,"&gt;For example, with the holographic equation (eqn 24) - if we plug in the CODATA rest mass of the proton we yield a radius, that radius was confirmed within one sigma of our measured value at the latest accelerator experiments.  So what I'm seeing here is that he multiplies the surface area of the sphere, and multiplies it by the planck mass. Which seems strange, because mass is generally connected to volume, not area. I assume this part of his whole holographic idea, but he doesn't justify why this is done.   Then he just straight out divides the PSUs out of the protons area, despite these PSUs supposedly being spheres. That's odd, because if you'd try to combine those spheres, then because of gaps between the spheres, you won't ever get the exact same volume as the proton. Unless these areas are weirdly shaped, but their volume is based on a sphere.. soo.. that's strange. I don't see a justification for this either.   Then he divides the surface mass over the area? Why?  And he adds a random factor 2, which I don't see any justification for either.    In the end he gets a number that is sort of close to the measured value, but it isn't within experimental bounds, and the method and lack of justification for any of this still makes me think he's just cherry picking random variables again. Like, why a proton? There's tons of other particles, why not work with them? By just selecting whatever particle you want, picking some variables that sound like they might be kind of related but aren't really, and by then introducing random factors (that 2), you could make basically any number you want.   It doesn't really feel like it's the logical/causal model you claim it to be, unless there's a huge chunk of explanation that I'm missing (and which would've been great to have in the paper)  I'm not really seeing the dark energy fix in the pdf you linked either, would you mind elaborating? It seems that at the end he just divides the mass of the universe by its size, which yeah is kind of the way you get the density of the universe. Technically he uses his proton based mass thing, but that still feels like it's a rather arbitrarily picked value. In the end he gets a density that is way below what is necessary (the lower bound is seemingly at least 5 *10^-30, with most indicating something closer to 10^-29), that difference is the entire point of requiring dark energy.",conspiracy

67959,"I personally think it was to do with the consistency in which Roadhog could OHK, in that if you did land the hook on an enemy ""squishy"" they were certainly dead. A change that I would have been happy to see in Roadhog was a slight reduction to the length of his hook, for example reducing it from 20 meters to somewhere between 12-15 meters.  However, when it comes to heroes like, for example Hanzo, you may not hit every scatter arrow and if you did then every scattered arrow may not even hit! And this can be said the same for Roadhog due to a player needing to be accurate with the hook. (I personally I as a player have not been killed by scatters as much as they have done damage to me so that might be why I don't understand the hate towards the OHKs..)  I think OHKs make the game exciting as it adds to that element of risk when running into a certain hero! But having a low margin of error on a hero when performing a OHK and having other heroes potentially not be as consistent I think that needs to be addressed.

The most convincing explanation is that it was a 'nondecision.'  It was expected by all the upper echelons of U.S. officials that, once developed, the bomb would be used.  Roosevelt's Hyde Park Aide Memoire seemed to assume that also.  Truman never regretted the use of these weapons to end World War II, but he was prudent about their use thereafter.""(James E.

69246,"First time watcher, first time participating in a rewatch, have posted in most of the threads.  Well now we know why the show's called Love Live. The show's plot moved forward heavily - we had progress on the student council president, saving the school, improving the girls, and figuring out who was filming things. The episode was so dense with plot and characterization that I went back and watched it again.  Hanayo was pretty adorable nerding out over the idols; she really does become a different person when she gets to let out her inner otaku.  Maki is back to being best girl and being the mature voice of reason. For a first-year she seems like the oldest of them. Her embarrassment at being photographed was incredibly endearing, and her fearless confrontation of the student council president was an awesome moment.  With the exception of the breast-grabbing, I was a big fan of how frequently Nico got shut down. I mean, on top of Honoka shutting down Nico's attempt to show off how informed she was, they literally shoved her into a room and closed the door. I actually felt bad for her on the first viewing; on the second, I realized she was being obnoxiously self-important. And while Nico is clearly not book smart or as smart as she thinks she is, I thought her attempt to use her Nico-Nico personality to improve her studies was smart. She has some depth to her.  I know that Honoka is a bit of an airhead, but her math skills are just... a whole series of educators failed that poor girl. I liked seeing her back in her casual outfit; I just really love that look.  Eli's development was probably the most interesting thing about the episode. The revelation that she's being such a raging colossal bitch to the idols because she thinks she's better than them isn't a huge surprise; the fact that she actually has reason to believe that to be true is. And she does clearly care about her family; she's got that Russian coldness, but she loves her sister and her grandmother - and the school that her grandmother loved as a child. I hope she takes an enormous chill pill, because while I like her characterization and writing, I'd like to like the character, ya know?  Cultural notes: I get the feeling that a Live is a term for a concert or something in Japan. The show showed how seriously the senpai/kouhai relationship are taken when Maki backed down on her confrontation with Eli. I think maybe that contributes to why the girls didn't go screaming to the cops when Nozomi kept repeatedly assaulting them. Like, I get to a certain extent that there's a trope in anime that ""it's okay if they're both girls,"" and I feel like that contributed to me being less appalled than I thought I would be when I saw it. That, and the first girl to get the ""treatment"" was Nico, who I love to hate. I felt disturbed with myself for feeling like it was normal.  Also, I finished Re:Zero, and I noticed that Subaru from that show used the -chi honorific as well. In that show, it implied great familiarity and also a certain babying/moetization. It was very interesting to me that Nozomi kept referring to Eli with the -chi honorific, implying greater closeness between them than I expected. On the other hand, she also used -chin for Honoka, and she *clearly* has issues with people's boundaries and propriety, so maybe that's just how she is.  As an educator I was interested to see Honoka's grades - grades in other anime seem to be out of 100, but she got a 53. That wouldn't be a pass in most educational systems I know of, but I get the impression that there's more room for individual differentiation in the Japanese system, with maybe overall harder tests with a lower pass threshold. I wish I could read the smaller moon runes under her grade; freeze-framing it didn't help. The first character looks like a squashed ""100,"" maybe, but I think it's just illegible.",anime

52017,"Do you think having a mode that limited the players' hero choices would be less frustrating? That way you won't have to solo heal the Hanzo/Widow/Genji.   That's how I feel anyway, and I think there are at least 3 ways Blizzard could do it.   1. Mystery Heroes that nudges the team towards a 2-2-2. This was recently discussed by Jeff on the Overwatch forums so it seems within the realm of possibility.   2. Quick Play except you can only lock 2-3 DPS maximum. Just like when someone has already locked Genji and now he's not selectable, if your teammates win the ""instalock a DPS"" race you will not be selecting a DPS this game. Having to race for the role you want to play might feel bad sometimes, but it would be better than the last person to pick always going Hanzo even though we have no healers.   3. A mode where you queue as a role (healer/tank/DPS) and the matchmaking tries to assemble a passable team composition.  If you need to change heroes for countering reasons you can still do that, but you can only flex within your chosen role.  This would probably be the hardest to code which is why it isn't my first suggestion, but I know nothing.   There are downsides to all of these ideas but it's better than what we have now.  It's really frustrating to see people treat Quick Play like it's Call of Duty and focus exclusively on getting those sick frags. There can be a mode for that too, but I don't want to play it. Maybe we can call it ""No Limits"".",Overwatch

38655,"In OW (and more broadly in gaming) there are two main ways to handle shooting mechanically; you can have the shooter spawn a physical object when they shoot, which follows a defined path with a certain speed/trajectory/physics behavior; or you can use a technique where you essentially define a cone where the player is looking, and when they fire, the game picks a point in that cone and ""scans"" for what it hits (a player, a wall, nothing, et cetera) without actually spawning any physical object.  In practice, what this means is that heroes that use projectiles have to factor in travel time when they aim and lead their targets, where hitscan heroes can just point at the target and fire and be sure to hit. That makes them a little easier to to be effective with, and better at taking down heroes that move unpredictably, since they don't have to predict to hit. Projectile heroes often also tend to do more interesting things than ""bullets""; Pharah's rockets, for instance, or Hanzo's arrows, or Junkrat's bombs.",Overwatch

He's made Pro Bowls in different systems under different coaches.   KC has let corners go each year because they know EB can make up for their failures.

I'm not speaking in totality - you are partially correct when you say religion can be authoritarian. I know how and why science is a great method to discerning a wide type of truth. Many do not however, and I believe such inability arises in a lack of religious understanding. Innate trust (faith) that scientists (priests/politicians) have gathered and interpreted the data (text/polls) correctly. ""Science"" as a label is all that's needed for truth, just as ""God"" was before.   I'm not talking about dogma. I'm talking about the gaps religion fills/filled in the human experience.

Once that's done, they can start sharing and liking fake news between these accounts and, by doing so, increase the chance that facebook will display them to you.

The band was founded by Corey Taylor, also the vocalist from Slipknot, and former drummer Joel Ekman.  &gt; Early days Taylor's long time friend, Shawn Economaki, joined shortly after, and filled in as the bass player. The band had played clubs and bars with different guitarists - often filling the position for just one show. This time, Stone Sour recorded 2 demo tapes, in 1992 and 1994. Shortly after, in 1995, James (Jim) Root - who is now also part of Slipknot with Corey Taylor - joined the band. The group was complete, and in 1996 recorded another demo tape, and songs from which would later be used in 2002 on their self titled debut album, Stone Sour. The band was named after an alcoholic drink that consists of one part whiskey, one part orange juice, with a splash of sour mix.  &gt; In 1997 the band went on hiatus when Taylor and Root spent most of their time with Slipknot, who were another up-and-coming act in Des Moines at the time who were to soon earn a record deal. Jim Root also joined the band a year later, and Economaki went on to become their stage manager. Ekman stayed in Des Moines, and formed a family.  &gt; Debut album (""Stone Sour"") The band recorded their debut self-titled album in Cedar Falls, Iowa, which was released on 31 July 2002 in the UK, and on 1 August in the US. Aided by the song ""Bother"" which was featured on the Spider-Man soundtrack (credited only to Taylor), the album went on to become Gold. The band toured for six months with label mates Sinch and Chevelle before going on a temporary hiatus as Taylor and Root went back to join Slipknot for another album and tour.  &gt; Come What(ever) May, live album, and another hiatus The band came back in 2006 to release their second studio album, Come What(ever) May. They parted ways with drummer Joel Ekman to be with his nine year old son Issac Ekman who was diagnosed and died from brain cancer and later recruited current drummer, Roy Mayorga of Soulfly. The album was released on August 1, 2006. It was met with mediocre reviews from critics, and sold 8 million copies in the first week, allowing it to debut at number four on the Billboard 2000. The band toured for the next year and a half, releasing the Live in Moscow album exclusively to iTunes on August 14, 2007. Corey Taylor and James Root returned to Slipknot to record their fourth full length studio album, All Hope Is Gone. Mayorga is now performing with the band Black President. While on the road with Slipknot, Taylor and Root are said to be writing along with Roy writing while doing the Black Presidents gig for the next Stone Sour album.  &gt; Audio Secrecy As of 12th January 2010, Stone Sour had re-entered the recording studio to record their 3rd album, the first in four years. It was recorded and produced by the band and Nick Raskulinecz (a Grammy Award winning producer: Foo Fighters, Velvet Revolver, Rush, Alice In Chains; also produced their 2006's gold certified Come What(ever) May) at Blackbird Studios in Nashville, Tennessee. On June 10, the band released a free download of ""Mission Statement"", which was later released as a single on iTunes. The first official single, ""Say You'll Haunt Me"", however, was released on July 6, 2010. The album was released on September 7, 2010 on Roadrunner Records. Audio Secrecy is also the first studio album by Stone Sour that does not feature a spoken word track, with ""Omega"" and ""The Frozen"" on Stone Sour and Come What(ever) May, respectively (however, ""The Frozen"" was a bonus track).  &gt; House of Gold &amp; Bones The Absolute Zero Songfacts reports that Stone Sour's fourth long-player, House of Gold &amp; Bones - Part 1, is the first part of a double concept album (the 2nd part is obviously titled ""House of Gold &amp; Bones - Part 2""). The two records are about a young man struggling with growing up. Read more on Last.fm.

27184,"Ok lets take a look at this article you provided  &gt;Women who are virgins when they marry are less likely to divorce within five years than those who have multiple partners before marriage. Next least likely to divorce are those who had one premarital partner.  Ok exactly what i've been saying  &gt;Women who had two sex partners prior to marriage have consistently had higher divorce rates within five years even than those with higher numbers of partners. People with two premarital partners are more likely to divorce than those with three to nine. Only recently has the divorce rate been highest among women with 10 or more premarital partners than among those who had two.  &gt;But the difference is so slight it's not statistically significant  The difference between two and 10+ is not statistically significant which was surprising to the researcher. Not disputing that and he even gives an explanation, which I also hypothesized earlier in this comment thread.   This is NOT saying there is no statistical difference between those with 3, 4, 5 to 10+. Only that 2 and 10+ are statistically similar in this study.    &gt;He theorized it's the case of the one who got away. Presumably, the woman married one of her two premarital partners, but the other creates ""an over-emphasized comparison. It's like in historical romance novels where the woman is agonizing between two suitors. That second one is a viable option.""  50% chance that the guy you married is the worst person you've had sex with.   &gt;Other research has shown that premarital sex impacts marital quality.  &gt;""Our findings were quite in line with what (Wolfinger's) study found. The number of sexual partners someone had had before marriage was associated with marital quality and a higher number is associated with lower quality across the first two years,"" said Galena K. Rhoades,   Exactly what I've been saying.  &gt; Caucasian and black women were similar in terms of their sexual behaviors prior to marriage. Hispanics and ""others"" had ""notably fewer"" sex partners and also lower divorce rates than whites or blacks.   Hispanics and Asains have lower sexual parners and lower divorce rates.   &gt;Since 2000, one-third of marriages involving women who had 10 or more premarital partners end in divorce within five years, the report said, but Wolfinger added a caveat. ""This is the result most readers of this brief expected: A lot of partners mean a lot of baggage, which makes a stable marriage less tenable. It's also entirely likely that the correlation is spurious, the product of certain personal characteristics. For example, people who suffered childhood sexual abuse are more likely to have extensive sexual histories,"" he wrote. ""Childhood abuse also increases the odds of a problematic marriage.""  Pretty much in line with what i've been saying. You can't say that hooking up with 10 people is the reason for higher marriage failures, but the fact is 10+ is shown to have the highest divorce rates. Whether that be because of religious factors, morals, sexual abuse it doesn't matter.  It is risky to marry a tinder whore. ",nba

The issue is that players are not used to having to work so hard to figure things out.   &gt;I do not agree with the philosophy that we should just make balance changes solely to shift people off the meta   This, so much this.. Thank you Jeff.   &gt;Regarding the meta changing because players have innovated a new strategy – well – this is the best-case scenario. We’ve seen this happen time and time again.

27515,"**Sade**    [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/5b0ed0597fdf476cac48fc7c64f264be.png)    &gt; Sade (pronounced ""shah-day"") is a Grammy-winning British smooth jazz band named after their lead singer Sade Adu. The band's music features elements of jazz, funk, soul and rnb.   &gt; Sade was formed in 1982, when members of a Latino-soul band Pride — Sade Adu, (real name Helen Folasade Adu - born 16 January 1959 in Ibadan, Nigeria) Stuart Matthewman and Paul Spencer Denman — together with Paul Cook formed a splinter group and began to write their own material. Sade made their debut in December 1982 at Ronnie Scott's Club in London, England, in support of Pride. Later, in 1983, Andrew Hale joined Sade. In 1984 Paul Cook left the band.  &gt; Sade Adu, the band's singer, is the daughter of a Nigerian father and an English mother. After her mother returned to England, Sade grew up on the North End of London. Developing a good singing voice in her teens, Sade worked part-time jobs in and outside of the music business. She listened to Ray Charles, Nina Simone, Al Green, Aretha Franklin, and Billie Holliday. Sade studied fashion design at St. Martin’s School of Art in London while also doing some modeling on the side.  &gt; Around 1980, Adu started singing harmony with a Latin funk group called Arriva. One of the more popular numbers that the group would perform was a Sade original co-written with bandmember Ray St. John, “Smooth Operator,” that would later become Sade’s first stateside hit. The following year Adu joined the eight-piece funk band Pride as a background singer. The band included future Sade band members guitarist/saxophonist Stuart Matthewman (a key player in ’90s urban soul singer Maxwell’s success) and bassist Paul Denman. The concept of the group was that there could shoot-offs. In essence, a few members within the main group Pride formed mini-groups that would be the opening act. Pride did a lot of shows around London, stirring up record company interest. Initially, the labels wanted to only sign Adu, while the group members wanted a deal for the whole band. After a year, the other band members told Adu, Matthewman, and Denman to go ahead and sign a deal. Adding keyboardist Andrew Hale, the group signed to the U.K. division of Epic Records.  &gt; In May 1983, Sade performed at Danceteria Club in New York, NY, United States. It was the first US Sade show. They received more attention from the media and record companies and separated finally. On 18 October 1983 Sade Adu signed with Epic Records. The rest of the band signed in 1984. All Sade albums were released through this label.  &gt; Their debut album, Diamond Life (with overall production by Robin Millar), went Top Ten in the U.K. in late 1984. January 1985 saw the album released on CBS’ Portrait label and by spring it went platinum off the strength of the Top Ten singles “Smooth Operator” and “Hang on to Your Love.” The second album, Promise (November 1985), featured “Never As Good As the First Time” and arguably her signature song, “The Sweetest Taboo,” which stayed on the U.S. pop charts for six months. Sade was so popular that some radio stations reinstated the ’70s practice of playing album tracks, adding “Is It a Crime” and “Tar Baby” to their play lists. In 1986, Sade won a Grammy for Best New Artist.  &gt; Sade’s third album was 1988’s Stronger Than Pride and featured their first number one soul single “Paradise,” “Nothing Can Come Between Us,” and “Keep Looking.” A new Sade album didn’t appear for four years. 1992’s Love Deluxe continued the unbroken streak of multi-platinum Sade albums, spinning off the hits “No Ordinary Love,” “Feel No Pain,” and “Pearls.” While the album’s producer Mike Pela, Matthewman, Denman, and Hale have gone on to other projects. The new millennium did spark a new scene for Sade. She issued Lovers Rock in fall 2000 and incoporated more mainstream elements than ever before. Debut single “By Your Side” was also a hit among radio and adult-contemporary listerners. The following summer, Sade embarked on their first tour in more than a decade, selling out countless dates across America. In early 2002, Sade celebrated their success of the tour by releasing their first ever live album and DVD, Lovers Live.  &gt; Sade made a great contribution to development of modern music. They dismantled many of the old music business ways and quite promptly became a fully functioning autonomous unit with a firm grip on every aspect of the recording process.  &gt; Sade is first and foremost a live act. Sade Adu said in one of her interviews: ""When we play I know that the people love the music. I can feel it."" Throughout their history, Sade have always attracted a diverse, multi-racial audience who are drawn by the band's open-minded approach to music. ""And that's the best thing we've achieved.""  &gt; Soldier of Love, Sade's first official studio album since the multi-platinum release of Lovers Rock in 2000, was released on 8th February, 2010.   &gt; Sade is also two piece stoner rock from Prague, Czech republic.

29337,"I'm from the capital and study in Ghent, the second largest city in Flanders. In Brussels, there is absolutely no willingness to split up. Frankly, most of the people there (french as well as dutch speaking) would loathe the idea, because the Flemish separatists like to claim the capital as their own although less than 20% of the people here speak dutch. I think the same sentiments are felt in Wallonia.  I don't think I really understand the mood in Flanders, so I can't speak to that part. But I don't think there is a lot of support for actual independence, more for larger separation of government. You could compare it to the US where some people want more power shifted to the states.  I've been afraid for some time now that the strategy for the Flemish separatists has been to stretch out the negotiations and pointing the finger at the frenchspeaking politicians for not giving in for so long that they can somehow get to independence that way. Bart De Wever, the leader of the separatists, actually said something like ""We are willing to negotiate, but not when that means we have to give in on anything"".   There has yet to be any sort of real outcry from the people for anything. They're were one or two demonstrations, but they didn't have a solid message, more like ""let's just make a government, you guys"". It's all kind of depressing and a lot of youths won't care as long as it's not really affecting them. I've been hoping for a long time that a student movement would stand up and take real action, but nothing of consequence has been done by anyone.  Personally, I think the idea of separatism in any form in a united Europe is retarded and every economic reasoning behind it is a very devious form of latent racism. Besides that, the separatist's economic policies are nothing short of insane.   TLDR: Brussels and Wallonia don't want to, Flanders kinda wants to but not really. Most people don't care too much yet.

This means people don't wait until they're deathly ill which costs a lots more than if it were prevented in the first place.

14414,"First time smoking salvia was in my dorm bathroom (we shared a bathroom with only one other room). Twas with my best friend. First two rips, I definitely felt something but not the whole effect. I took another and sat in my chair with Radiohead playing on itunes with the visualizer open. I felt as if I was on a rollercoaster when you're slowly going to the top of the hump. The visualizer felt like it was almost coming at me and I was moving towards it, it was very enjoyable so I decided to take one more hit. The instant I opened the bathroom door after the hit, time froze and I felt as if I was barrel rolling at light's speed. At the same time I thought I was stuck in that moment of time for eternity, and kind've accepted it. I don't think I snapped out of it until my friend grabbed me and asked if I was alright. Even after I felt as though I was in a disney world for the next ten minutes, I specifically remember thinking the fairy god mother was with me leading me along. After I synced back with reality a little bit I got unbelievably cold and sat in my bed, crying over the thought of my dog that died a year earlier. TL;DR - Salvia was unbelievably beautiful at first, and chillingly depressing afterwards. I wouldn't recommend doing it unless you're in a relatively peaceful state of mind. ",trees

35372,"&gt; despite the capitalist pigs.  That's why I don't care: you are implying some kind of message in the things I wrote, which simply isn't there. You're perception is clouded by your desperation.   I don't care, because it's not my place to care. I've cared a few years ago and then it turned out that ""caring"" doesn't help.  Anyways, you can have those weapons, I don't care. I really don't. Use them, tell yourself, that they gonna help you getting those territories back.   I'm not a nihilist. I'm a realist. The only solution for Ukraine is getting Russia to agree to fuck off. Gifting weapons to Ukraine, won't change shit. Russia is completely ok with the situation right now. A ton of new weapons will simply kill a few more people. Aks Putin how much he cares about that. If there's one thing Russia has, besides gas and oil, it's a bigger shitload of old weapons.  So what will we have in the end? The US will gift you some weapons. By that they'll make sure to get a foot into the market. They'll start making money, thanks to the fucked up situation in the Donbass region. Ok, not they, the military-industrial complex. Nothing will change after that. A few, ok a lot more, people will get shot. A lot of ammunition will be spent, but wait, now you're firing that other shit. Not the old AK ammo. Now you started using the NATO ammo. Someone will have to sell you new ammo, after you started using the new shit. Let's guess, who that will be.  And then, hmm, wait if one batallion is starting to use the new weapons, then why stop there. You can't have different systems, that would be stupid. No army is using the Russian and the NATO system at the same time. You would need to buy ammunition for both systems. Nah, that's bullshit, let's simply switch...I guess, you will need a few more weapons, in order to have a uniform system in the army. So now someone needs to sell you a few more rifles.   And if you're already using the rifles, why stop there? What about your outdated RPGs...we all know, that the US anti-armor weapons are way more effective, you want to buy a few? We have a good deal for you and if you want we could get you a few used F-16, too. Poland has them and some other EE countries. And if you actually plan on becoming a NATO member, it would be best if you would buy them as soon as possible.  So now 10-15 years have passed, you have new American rifles, new anti-tank weapons and some new (used) nice airplanes. But the Donbass will still be, in the best case scenario some kind of Transnistria like republic, where nobody shoots anybody, in the worst case a fuckin war-zone. The only difference will be the ammunition you fire. And a few people, who got rich(er) along the way. A few Ukrainian guys are quite happy reading these news right now, I'm sure. They're sitting in your army and are ready to get bribed.  But yeah, I don't care, you can have those weapons. I'm not against it. They won't change a thing. *That's* why I don't care. Because they won't change shit. ",europe

55980,"It is a combination of the  glass and the ceramic together.  ""Safety Glass"" is designed to fracture into small, non jagged polygons.  It does this by having a high surface tension layer relative to the rest of the glass.  A similar (or at least analogous), ""macro"" version of this is what happens with [dried lake beds](http://i.imgur.com/4l3xgUG.jpg) but instead of at an atomic scale, and instantly, like glass... it is at a relatively massive scale, and very slowly.  Safety Glass also has a property called ""Hardness"" (as defined by a material's resistance to scratching) which is sometimes measured using ""Mohs Hardness Scale""... a score from 1 - 10 (higher is more hard, pure diamond is the hardest with a score of 10).  Safety Glass in side windows is ~7.  These ""Ninja Rocks"" as they are sometimes called are made from Aluminum Oxide which has a Mohs score of 9... so almost diamond level hardness.  That means when it fractures, the edges and points are extremely durable to impact.  Just like a knife is better at cutting meat than a flat bar made of the same steel, those points can, with a minimal amount of energy, penetrate the less hard glass surface, thereby releasing the tension inherent in the glass and ""popping"" it like a balloon.  So while density (mass to volume) is a way of putting more energy into impact (depleted uranium rounds for example), that isn't the most important factor here.  [Here is a dramatic demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=44&amp;v=h_QeBqyWuDE) of where ""more energy"" is trumped by ""sharp and hard"".

59226,"The tour isn't similar, you're not wrong. But ihavenoenemies' tours were probably MORE work. Bieber doesn't have to worry about setup or managing his equipment or producing his own shows. He just shows up, performs, and then parties if he feels like it and goes back to a fancy hotel.  Small bands end up playing just as many shows while also managing their own equipment and instruments (Bieber doesn't even play anything most of the time so he just has to take care of his voice, and in big shows like his lip-syncing is often employed anyway). They also usually have to organize their own accommodations and transportation which are nowhere near as luxurious.  Bieber has it pretty damn good. Playing 150 shows like he did is par for the course when you're and performer. The only thing that is more challenging for him is the weight of fame - in every other regard as a performer he's on easy street.  I also wouldn't fault him or any other performer for taking time off. The only really crappy thing is that he cancelled rhe rest of his tour which lets down lots of fans and also costs some of them quite a bit of money since many people book travel and accommodations to go see shows, which can be nonrefundable.  Being a performer is tough but a big part of it is also knowing your limits and knowing not to overwork yourself. Same as any job.",Music

366,"Obligatory first time watcher, first rewatch thread, posted in most of the threads so far.  Crunchyroll's subtitles kept screwing up so I missed some of the dialogue, and watching the episode was a bit more frustrating than usual. I still enjoyed it, mostly.  At the beginning of the episode, we see that the girls' hard work has already started to pay off - actual recognition, a delay in shutting down the school, and a bump in their space. I imagine that Eli had something to do with this - in an earlier episode it seemed that the student council had considerable control over clubs. Even if they don't have explicit control, she's obviously got it good with the Director. From what I've gathered from other anime and from what the internet says, clubs are accountable to faculty advisers, but the student council seems to have a lot to do with organization.  Honoka genuinely is a force of nature. They see her coming and just know that there's nothing they can do but accept the glomp.  Umi makes it sound like Maki doesn't have a good head on her shoulders. Don't you do that to best girl. Like, pretty much every episode she's pointing out all the hurdles they still have to cross and shutting down people who are going to far. And Maki, what are you doing with Nico? No, girl, you've got so many better options.  I love how they just straight-up call out how yuri-baity Eli is, with Honoka's long, lingering evaluation. And I can't imagine that it's a coincidence that they flash the episode title - ""Wonder Zone"" - while the camera lingers on her legs and thighs (I know that it's actually the song about Akiba, but I can't imagine that the juxtaposition wasn't intentional. Nico getting mad that she's obviously not on Eli's level (in casual clothes *and* in the maid outfits), and then Nozomi making sure her waifu doesn't get to uppity, just adds to the comedy. It was just a really well-directed scene.  The trip to the school idol score just sounded straight-out pornographic. Hanayo and Rin need to keep it in their pants a little. And Nico is yet again causing trouble for people because she's putting the cart before the horse. Lady, you'll be hot shit at some point, and you're on your way there if you work really hard, but you don't need to be making everyone dress like a chilly asthmatic.  When I saw that Rin was legitimately fooled by Kotori's foreigner ""ruse,"" I immediately understood how she was failing in school. Everything immediately made sense. Also, Eli's face at that was absolutely priceless. Like, yeah, yeah, her heart is all melted and stuff, but she's constantly reminded that she's surrounded by idiots.  GODDAMN IT NOZOMI STOP GRABBING OR THREATENING TO GRAB PEOPLE'S TITS WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU? I thought Nico was the pro stalker, but Nozomi taking it to a new, rapey level is just... Jesus, somebody call the cops. Please. She's got some redeeming qualities but I'm 90% sure that the signs on subways about reporting improper sexual contact are because she's going around going washi-washi on all the women. Gross.  Kotori's attempts at writing lyrics remind me of Mio's lyrics from K-On, except that Kotori's both worse at it and knows that she's not very good. I mean, both are good and wholesome girls but there's only so much you can write about things being cute and fluffy.  Also, Kotori is legitimately adorable in her maid outfit - she's pretty cool otherwise, too, and very athletic, but working in a maid cafe suits her well. I almost understand why maid cafes are popular in Japan now. But I will never understand why Japanese people are comfortable with ruining a perfectly lovely omurice with... blech... *ketchup*. Related to that is Kotori's admonishment that Umi needs to keep her smile on even when she's backstage - retail and customer-service employees have to do a lot of ""emotional labor"" to pretend to be happy in order to make other people feel good. I'll tell you, it's exhausting.  Honoka-Umi-Kotori lesbian poly triad is now canon.  On a fashion note, in addition to Nico having a casual outfit that looks a lot like a more straightened-out version of Honoka's top, Rin seems to have the same thing going on. I bet that's been the case this whole time and I just haven't paid attention. I thought I saw the same thing going on with Nozomi, but closer inspection makes me think that she's got a halter top or something like that underneath instead of a tank.  Cultural notes: While watching, as soon as I saw that picture of Kotori, I thought she must have had something to do with selling all of that unlicensed merchandise, so her being a maid cafe performer came out of left field. But maybe Japan has a less stringent legal perspective on copyright and image rights. I can't imagine being able to have a massive doujinshi market in the United States or most Western markets, but obviously that scene flourishes in Japan.  On a detail note, when Eli said goodbye to Umi and Honoka, she was turning into a street with a sign saying ""Matryoshka."" I went down the rabbit hole for a bit on researching Russians in Japan and the influence of the Russian Orthodox Church, but Eli's family isn't particularly special. Her grandmother *might* have been the child of refugees from the Russian Civil War, apparently called in Japan the ""White Russians."" That would also explain, timeline-wise, why Eli's family went back to Russia during her childhood and the post-Soviet reforms, and then why they'd head back in time for school with the increasingly unstable political situation and economy.",anime

It's fine to call the police if someone throws something at you from a car.  You want that person identified and stopped from doing that.  But, do you really want that person charged with assault and given a criminal record over throwing a piece of food?  Do you really want the court to spend its time and resources on that?  When you weren't even harmed in the slightest?  Personally, I would want a consequence that ensured that the person didn't do it again, but didn't ruin their life over something so trivial.  What such a consequence was would obviously depend on the circumstances and context.  Perhaps being arrested would be frightening enough to scare someone into not doing such a thing again, in which case an apology might be appropriate.  If there is doubt as to that, perhaps community service or a similar consequences would be appropriate - I know the Crown is empowered to make all sorts of deals, sometimes without requiring a guilty plea and therefore a criminal record.  If there is some other issue, such as mental health, that led to it, then I'd just be happy with an apology and them getting the help they need.  I think what we have to remember here is that although the charge is assault, no one was actually harmed.  What we are talking about is someone throwing a piece of pizza.  Even if it had hit, it wouldn't have hurt anyone.  At worst, it would have soiled his clothing.  Why do you want to wreck someone's life over this?",canada

39572,"Legion, like WoD has some detrimental factors, but I think a lot of the positive features in Legion are evolutions over MoP and WoD.  The Challenge Dungeons evolved into Mythic+.  The rotating dailies and daily zones evolved into the World Quest system.  The crafting system staying relevant as a catch up mechanic evolved from WoD's crafting system.  Class Order Halls add to the game without feeling like WoW is becoming a mobile management game, the way Garrisons were.  The trickling content was started in MoP and evolved into what we have today.  Some things did take a step back, though.  The leveling experience, although temporary, is a downgrade from WoD.  The legendaries system is a tough sell.  MoP started and WoD continued the trend of ""everyone gets a legendary if you put in the time!""  Legion tried to keep that, but make it rewarding early and stay relevant.  They did not do a great job of that, IMO.  I'm fine with the idea of RNG based legendary drops, but there should be a system to work towards replacements so you don't get totally hosed by RNG.  Also, the more screwed you get with the current system, the worse off you are as it's increasingly harder to get further legendaries.  On its own, the biggest system Legion added seems to be Artifacts.  Overall, I rate them well.  Artifact Knowledge has served as a nice gate/catch up mechanism that rewards the grind, but still enables relative catch up.  Interestingly, they're not done with artifacts yet.  I also wonder how they'll move on from the artifact system in the next expansion.  Overall, I'd say Legion feels better than WoD, but it also took a lot of features and feedback from WoD to make Legion possible.",wow

I forget at which level it is exactly maybe u18 or u19s after you play an official FIFA match you can still switch but it is a one time switch which you have to apply for. Before that you can switch back forth which can be seen by some English/Irish players like Dan Crowley. But once you reach a certain age it is a one time switch like Jack Grealish who can not switch back to Ireland despite not playing for England's senior team yet.   And once your capped at senior level in a competitive fixture you can't switch through naturalization. You can't switch through naturalization even if you have only played youth international for another country. ,soccer

That was a part of hockey then, and it still is (though to a lesser degree now)  The gretzky era was part of the golden age of the ""goon"" (a low skill player who was on the ice to hit the other team at any opportunity, protect their own teammates, and throw down the gloves to fight when necessary)  Dave Semenko was Gretzkys goon for alot of his career, including most of his days with the Oilers.  They were almost always on the ice together.  If someone tried to hurt Gretzky, or even if they laid a big, clean hit on him, you can bet Semenko is gonna be punching you in the face for it.    So basically yes, high skill hockey players get messed with all the time and Gretzky was absolutely no different..  But especially during that era, if you are laying the big hit, you BETTER be ready to defend yourself.   ALSO, If you are doing things against the rules to hurt or slow down Gretzky, you are gonna get yourself a penalty and find your team down a man in a 5v4 for 2 minutes versus the greatest scorer of all time.

It's just three simple slashes but your imagination fills in the rest with the descriptions given. And the [anime version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiFDnDmLyII) just makes your imagination come to life. Saber's intuition is shown, the impossible speed of three strikes at once is shown.

The majority use on-hit items,  and items like deaths dance(which is broke) since they are a cheaper powerspike and are great against tanks.   3. Mages are not weak at all. In fact control mages and burst mages are extremely strong right now that many of them such as Orianna, Syndra, and Taliyah are getting nerfs. Plus mages have very good itemization that can also counter tanks, with the only AD items noticeably better is giant slayer or executioner.   4. Knight's Vow and Ardent censer is exactly why supports are a stronger role right now. They are the ones responsible for the increase in an AD's power/sustainability, and putting an AD in a higher light for another role's job is just unfair to the support role as that is they're contribution.

53427,"Gah, I had a long reply that I was working on but I accidentally hit ""home"" and killed it.  Oops.  I've been enjoying talking about this too! Always interesting to toss these ideas around!  I do agree that there is a certain appeal to human ears in, say, a melodic note on the piano that isn't necessarily there in the same way for the shrill shriek of a dog whistle.  I don't think it makes the piano note objectively ""good"" though, and I also don't think it makes it impossible for the dog whistle to show up in music.  My view of objectivity is that, in order for something to be objectively true, it must be true independently of humanity.  For instance, the fact that the moon exists is objectively true as it's there.  The fact that the moon is pretty is subjectively true.  I ultimately think that beauty and irritatingness fall way on to the subjective side in that there's no intrinsic quality of beauty attached to the sound waves of a piano note, just like there's no intrinsic quality of annoyingness attached to the dog whistle.  Dissonance and consonance combined may profoundly affect people in one way, but other types of music affect them in other ways.  For instance, ambient music may totally abandon those ideas depending on which ambient music it is.  It may still profoundly affect people, however, in that it may conjure a powerful and almost visual sense of atmosphere (like looking at a painting of a marsh, or being immersed in some bizarre, surreal world) or it may relax the listener in to an almost trance-like state, and leave them feeling refreshed and cleansed as if the music had given their brain a rejuvenating rinse and massage.  Jazz is another good example.  It strays away from tightly structured melodies and seeks to unleash the human creativity of the players.  So the chords are often sort of open, allowing for plenty of melodic freedom for the improvisers.  Jazz most definitely can have a powerful effect on listeners in that listening to jazz is like listening to creativity in its pure form; straight from the mind of the player to your mind.  Or, as a great reddit submission once put it, it's like an artistic tribute to the human mind's ability to create beauty.    In reference to the dog whistle...I've read about this woman who makes musical compositions out of that high pitched squealing sound you get when you pinch the airhole of a balloon and let a little air deflate out.  I don't like her music, but some people think it's great abstract art and/or fun and playful.    A less extreme example would be the dog whistle sound at the end of Sgt. Pepper.  It's certainly a harsh noise but it works within the artistic context--I think it adds to the album's overall vibe of exploring new musical ideas and challenging established ideas of music.  Another good example is the high pitched guitar ""whale song"" shrieks in Pink Floyd's ""Echoes.""  Within that musical context (backed by atmospheric, otherwordly sound effects and in the middle of a dreamy song about the ocean), they sound like some incredibly surreal, otherworldly, powerful form of poetry.  They've got nothing to do with traditional musical structure, notes, or harmony, but they certainly can have a powerful effect.  I get troubled by my own views on music sometimes.  Am I accepting a view of music that basically abandons the idea of quality standards and accepts everything?  Am I accepting the possibility of a future where some guy farts in to a tape recorder, loops it for 46 minutes, adds some scrambled sounds from an infomercial and dissonant chords, and releases it as a postmodern work of art?    Maybe.  But I think this is where your thoughts on how the human mind reacts to sound come back in to the picture.  It's true that any sound can be music, but it doesn't mean that any sound can be music that many people will actually connect with or get any value from.  And I think it's true that the farther away an artist strays from musical tradition, the more listeners they will lose and the fewer minds will find value in what the artist is saying.  But I don't think the quality of art is defined by how many people are able to connect with it.  I think the quality of art is like the quality of food--subjective.  And each mind finds the music that speaks to it the most powerfully.  I think the fact that so many different types of music connect powerfully in so many different ways with so many people is an indication that musical quality is subjective, and it depends on what you're looking for in a musical experience.",Music

Us Americans are absolutely garbage at saving money. I personally can't afford a 500 dollar emergency, but that's all the fault of my own spending habits and not because of wages or anything like that because the minimum wage here is pretty good.

I don't know how that compares to the other nations on the list, but that makes the US situation less dire. The EU, Eurozone, and the UK also all rank pretty highly as well on percent of GDP as debt, with each being around 80-90% of debt as GDP compared to the US' 107%  China, the country that will replace the US eventually as the strongest economy, has a much higher percentage than originally let on, as most of their debt is actually from local governments.    ""By 2015, local government entities owed a total of about 18 trillion yuan (about one-third of China's economy)"" - en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_China#Local_and_provincial_debt  I don't know how much of that debt of theirs is from their own citizens, but they definitely are on a rocky boat as well.

We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.  **If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*  If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).  **If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.  * /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar       * /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback * /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback * /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback * /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks   * /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations * /r/remix - share your remixes * /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*  The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.  As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

36478,"That's a fair thing to say, I guess I meant that in part, I think Sanchez wouldn't sign anyway so offering it just somewhat sets a terrible precedent for other players. We offer Sanchez 300k a week, but he leaves, so Ozil is like.... well I'm leaving unless I get 300k a week. Then Walcott says he's leaving unless he gets 180k, because they offered 300k to Sanchez and on and on.  Ultimately he's 28, actually he'll be 29 in December, so if he stays with us he'll be almost 30 the next time he has a chance to play in the CL. If he signs for 4 years, he's basically saying he won't win a CL or league title till he's 32 and then he would hope a top team wants him at that age. The other option is leave at worst a year from now to a top team, for him the choice is pretty obvious so I think making huge offers only hurts Arsenal on the whole.  I'd like Sanchez to stay, but if he wants bigger money or more success he's got to stay elsewhere, if he loves Arsenal and thinks Wenger can win, he'd stay for a reasonable wage increase but we shouldn't break the bank to save one player.

27067,"**David Gilmour**    [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/9cc50f697bcc4737919865392afd4a09.png)    &gt; David Jon Gilmour, known as David Gilmour (born 6 March 1946 in Cambridge, England, United Kingdom) is an English musician and multi-instrumentalist, who was the guitarist, lead vocalist and one of the songwriters of the progressive rock band Pink Floyd.  &gt; Gilmour was born in Cambridge, England. His father, Douglas Gilmour, was a senior lecturer in zoology at the University of Cambridge and his mother, Sylvia (née Wilson), was a teacher and film editor who raised her family at Grantchester Meadows, later immortalised by a Roger Waters song on Pink Floyd's Ummagumma. Gilmour and his siblings were encouraged by their parents in their musical abilities. Gilmour has a younger brother, Peter, who has been a guitarist for a slightly longer time than Gilmour. Gilmour attended The Perse School on Hills Road, Cambridge, which he ""didn't enjoy"" but where he met future Pink Floyd guitarist and vocalist Syd Barrett, along with bassist and vocalist Roger Waters who attended Cambridgeshire High School for Boys, also situated on Hills Road. In 1954, Gilmour bought his first single, Bill Haley's ""Rock Around the Clock"". At age 13, Gilmour was given his first guitar, a Tatay, by his neighbour, Gilmour started learning how to play using a book and record set by Pete Seeger.  &gt; In September 1962, he studied modern languages to A-Level and, along with Syd Barrett, went to Cambridge Technical College. Despite not finishing the languages course, Gilmour would eventually become a fluent French speaker. Gilmour and Barrett spent their lunchtime practising guitar together, Barrett would often refer to Gilmour as ""Fred"". They were not yet bandmates, however, and Gilmour started playing in the band Jokers Wild in 1962, which Gilmour left in 1967.  &gt; Gilmour joined Pink Floyd in 1968, when he was asked to replace former front man and guitarist Syd Barrett.  Barrett was becoming increasingly difficult to work with (due to his deteriorating mental state), so Gilmour stepped in to fill the void. Gilmour's contributions helped to define what would become known as the ""Pink Floyd"" sound. With Roger Waters, Gilmour co-wrote many of Pink Floyd's classic songs, including ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond""(Itself about Syd), ""Wish You Were Here"" (about Roger's father) , ""Time"", ""Dogs"", ""Echoes"", ""Comfortably Numb"", and ""Run Like Hell"".  When Waters left the band in 1984 to pursue a solo career, Gilmour took over Pink Floyd as leader, and they released two more albums, A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987), and The Division Bell (1994).  Both albums performed very well, proving that the Pink Floyd name was stronger than any individual member.  On July 2, 2005, David Gilmour and Roger Waters briefly set aside their differences and performed as Pink Floyd for one final performance at Live 8.  The reunion was the most talked about event of the day, and sales of Pink Floyd's back catalogue shot through the roof.  Rumours of a full scale tour began to surface shortly after the show, with both Gilmour and Waters being offered millions of dollars, but it wasn't meant to be.  Neither Waters nor Gilmour showed much enthusiasm to work together again, with Gilmour being quoted as saying that he would rather spend his time pursuing his solo career.  &gt; Much to everyone's surprise, Gilmour and Waters reunited once again on July 11, 2010 for a charity performance for ""The Hoping Foundation,"" an organization that supports Palestinian refugee kids.  At Ronnie Scott's club in London, the duo performed four songs together: ""To Know Him is to Love Him"" (a cover of the old Teddy Bear's song), ""Wish You Were Here,"" ""Comfortably Numb,"" and finally (after a special request) ""Another Brick in the Wall Part 2.""  Once again, just like after the Live 8 Reunion, speculation began regarding future reunions.  No official Pink Floyd reunion has yet been set, but Gilmour did promise that he would join Roger Waters for one show on his 2010-11 ""The Wall"" tour, performing ""Comfortably Numb.""  The show that Gilmour is set to play is being kept a secret to surprise fans and (most likely) to prevent scalpers from selling tickets at outrageous prices.  &gt; The door now seems slightly ajar that David Gilmour and Roger Waters may possibly work with each other again, either as a duo, or as Pink Floyd once again.  On Roger Waters facebook page, he wrote: ""We (played together), and it was fucking great!  End of story.  Or possibly beginning.""  &gt; As a solo artist, David Gilmour has released 3 studio albums; David Gilmour (1978), About Face (1984), and On an Island (2006).

I think we have roughly the same idea on your last point. I think the larger demographic the better for football but would like the football to remain unchanged. I guess the difference is that, for me personally, half time is part of the match. The concerts effectively lengthen half time (not sure if you would consider that interfering with the football per se though).  This is a bit idealistic and definitely not in line with the modern world, in football and otherwise, but it would also be refreshing every now and then for people in football to make decisions based on the wishes and enjoyment of fans rather than profit.

I'm not shaming them for it, but it does break the immersion, to answer your question.  Those of us bothered by it should probably just move on, and hope it's a one time thing. It does, however, have a jump-sharky feel to it. And with the overhyped premiere that had very little energy, it just gives me a bad feeling.",gameofthrones

37639,"It's because /r/trees isn't really for news, as the mods will tell you, so the news that does run is sometimes behind the rest of reddit (thus, most people here are probably reading it for the first time); as such, they let almost all news pieces run when it involves cannabis because of the recent issues involving Jeff Sessions and his rejection of the Rohrabacher - Farr Amendment, which represents a direct threat to the legal standing of cannabis.- http://www.ocregister.com/2017/05/05/rohrabacher-says-hell-take-medical-marijuana-fight-with-jeff-sessions-to-supreme-court/  This kind of cyclical coverage happens because many in the trees community are not active consumers of media/news, which actually diminishes their standings in the democratic process (one must be informed to have an effect within the halls of representative governance).   To that end, encouraging these kind of articles (even if they are outdated) engenders the standing of the individual person in the lawmaking process, as the point is not so much to break a ""new story"", but rather teach all in the community about something they may have missed due to the transient nature of reddit's day to day userbase.  To that end, we must inculcate an ethos which encourages (not shames) posting information about ongoing political issues; as, in this way, we take back the halls of government and force the bells of democracy to toll once more.  To do otherwise invites a literal conflagration of monied faction to take over the law making process (as Madison warned of in Federalist no.10-http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed10.asp), which would end up swallowing whole the very oxygen the union needs to breathe (that essential freedom and liberty for which it was first conceived).",trees

26374,I was just thinking about this the other day and wondered why they increase the level caps with every expansion so as to completely destroy any reason to explore previously made content.  I started with WotLK and I at least got to do BRD and LBRS before I was at too high of a level to finish with the vanilla end game content but did none of the raids.  In outland I leveled even faster and didn't even touch TBC's endgame content or raids and know almost none of the story line behind that expansion.  I got to level 80 just before this last expansion so needless to say I've missed out on most of the WotLK heroics and the ones I did get involved with were at level 85 and somewhat faceroll.  And it's not like now that I have a couple of 85's I've abandoned them because they don't level anymore.  I have been grinding away in new zones and heroics trying to get enough vp and rep to buy some cool gear.  I can't say that I wouldn't try any less if the gear I was looking for made just a little bit of difference either (which is sometimes the case even though the item level difference is huge).

As one of the most important cities in the Americas, Montreal was on the cutting edge of the popularization of professional sports in the later 19th century.  We had a summer Olympics (although we're not especially proud of that one).  A hockey riot in 1955 is considered to be a turning point in our history.  Historically the best team in hockey.  Jackie Robinson.  Finally (and this is just my personal opinion) I think Montreal's the best place in the world to watch soccer on TV.  Unlike most other North American cities, Montreal loves soccer.  Fans of every team in the world live here and no team or nation has preponderance.  During the World Cup, you can watch almost any national team at a bar where you'll be surrounded by people (and supporters) of that nation.

Likewise, Europe isn't just one thing, there are lots of areas with huge distances here as well. Take northern Norway for instance. I live 5 hours by (a very expensive) bus from the nearest train station (not high speed trains). Airfares are insanely high and there are few planes each day.  My town has everything you need for daily life, but it's 3 hours by car from the next proper town and 5 hours from the next 'city'. Only a few areas are connected to the city centre with regular buses (every half hour in the middle of the day, every hour after 6pm), in the weekends and in some areas there are usually no more than 3-4 buses in a day, none 'late' at night. We pay 4-5 dollars for each trip, even if it's less than 5 minutes long. In addition, gas is extremely expensive, so owning a car might not help much. The landscape is very steep in most areas, making bikes impractical. And I live in a very connected place compare to smaller 'towns' in the area.

8007,"You are interpreting it incorrectly. Being locked to the company doesn't mean you aren't allowed to quit. In no first-world nation would such a contract be valid or enforceable.   Being locked to the company means if you are to compete in professional Overwatch, you have to do it for that company. It means you can't jump ship to another team.    Non-military employment contracts can't force you to stay at a job against your will in the U.S. Europe has even more worker-friendly contract law, and has historically thrown out contract provisions where someone is signing their rights away, so I'm assuming it applies there too.    You can put whatever you want in a contract, that doesn't mean it is legally enforceable. If you signed a contract saying you would give me your arm at a future date in exchange for a service, and I came to collect, a judge would throw that shit right the fuck out. ",Overwatch

26658,"The problem is that the French and British formed part of a common force, they did not fight separately. The troops cut off at Dunkirk were both French &amp; English. If you look at information for the battle of Dunkirk (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Dunkirk), you will see about 400,000 troops on the Franco-British side, all under command of the Supreme Commander of allied forces, Frenchman Maxime Weygand. About 338K were rescued, the rest were casualties. Of these 338K, 100K were French and evacuated aswell. Thats almost 1 in 3 soldier on the beach being French.   So the realistic film would have had almost as many British soldiers on the beach as French, both mingling and discussing.  I fully agree with your point about cinematography, but this is not the point here. I am saying the film shows some kind of ethnically 100% british battle of Dunkirk, when the Dunkirk evacuation involved 100,000 Frenchmen from a French city.  Its similar to portraying some major battle of WW2 or WW1 involving multiple nationalities and only portraying one nationality in it. Its pretty much historical revisionism but I accept it because I will enjoy the film as its Nolan making it.  But as a European and very much knowledgeable about WW2, this is not an accurate portrayal of what really happened. It must be said.  I think we need a Franco-German-British production but of course it will be less thrilling than Nolan directing the film.",movies

I discussed this in another post on this thread, I'll just quote it here:  The congressional mandate for coinage is as follows (Article 1, Section 8),  &gt;To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures;  The members of congress obviously aren't going to coin the money themselves. They are going to create a law that creates a branch of government that does that. Or, if they wanted to, they could always contract out that job to a private bidder. There is no distinction between these in constitutional law. The government uses private contractors all the time, it's perfectly legal and constitutional.  Look, I'd be willing to listen to a constitutional argument, or rebuttal, if you have one.  But, if you are claiming something is unconstitutional, I would prefer a constitutional argument.

Sorry if I repeated myself I usually do this on my computer and I didn't stop to really look at who was commenting, let's just do this in one thread.  You hit the nail on the head, I agree that you can't fully prove or disprove either side of the argument, but what I do know is that it is undeniable a higher intelligence designed us, and the only viable choice is the God of Adam, Abraham, and Moses. The creation story fits the discovery of science. Other religions, Muslims/Hindus/Buddhism all have painfully obvious errors, and they don't even try to prove there origin stories.  Your asking for my articles and research documents? I can direct you to a few good websites and videos of seminars if you like.  But I was really hoping just to hash it out man to man with what knowledge we both have. I don't like it when people link me to some ridiculously long boring article that neither of us actually understand. It's kind of like passing the buck, I'll do it only by request.   I watched the video, and ken didn't do a great job answering. But I suppose you can water down my response to 'nothing will change my mind ' but I did say a time machine would do the trick (I'm aware the science is impossible). However, the problem is you're giving me a question that's like saying, what evidence would you need to believe 2+2=3? Well, nothing, because the truth is etched into my heart,  my soul.    RCD hasn't been found faulty for it's rate of decay? There's no experiment to test it, it requires millions of years.   I do believe many scientists are pushing an agenda, many of them hate God and spew bile at the thought of intelligent design. But not all,  probably not even half are like that. What I'm saying is most scientists have been taught that creationism is simply impossible and the only choice they have is evolution. So they push it because that's what they were brain washed into. I've heard statistics that say most people who work and research in the field of the sciences believe in a higher power, I hope that's true.   Humans were designed prefect until we screwed it up with sin. But, regardless, our bodies are incredible machines, way to complex for a series of lucky chances to have mutated us into who we are. Are you familiar with the pocket watch in a field analogy?   Evolution is a religion, you take it on faith that billions of years have passed, you take it on faith that we spawned from some primordial soup, you believe this because a book told you so.   Christianity as a whole will never accept evolution into its doctrine because the theory violates God's word, and if God is a liar even one time, then He isn't good and everything else breaks apart.

No reason to expect this to be the case, and no way we could formally require it to be the case, since even as it stands, the custom of approving one judge from each member state is just that, a custom, not a rule. Once the UK ceases to be a member state, there is no reason to expect a British ECJ judge, when no 3rd country has ever been able to select a judge for the ECJ (nor, for that matter have the EEA members that Barnier recently confused for 3rd countries)  2.

69727,"Part 2:   &gt; families come in all shapes and sizes  Yes they are... but not in the sense you're thinking. They teach kids/teenagers the types of things they will encounter in their lives. Like I've said before being gay is not a choice so it makes sense that in schools they teach that some people are gay and how that works in sex ed. Families are a personal thing and every has their own, everyone treats and handles it different. Teachers are not teaching that families come in all shapes and sizes. Teachers don't teach how a family should be at all, in fact most do not ever teach anything about adoption (Pass Adoption being an alternative to having a biological child), very rarely is foster care every brought up, neither is who and who cannot adopt children (Unless asked by a child themselves and if the teacher knows the current legal standing well enough to answer said question). Schools facilitate discussion so to a degree given the right class room, with the right children, asking the right questions a topic of families and what's considered okay could occur though at a state school that discussion would be lead by students and moderated by teachers. Just because you don't accept that families ""Don't come in all shapes and sizes"" doesn't mean they don't, in a world where Gay's can legally get married, in some cases also then also adopt it's important that if the question arises people can discuss the issues, positives and effects of such a world. Schools are for engaging people in critical thinking and developing those skills. They aren't teaching people this, they are giving children/teens a space in which they can make their own mind up on the situation.  &gt; rights as a parent  Rights as a parent always, always come second to the rights of a child. Examples of this are plenty. If your kid does something you doesn't like (Let's pretend they decide God isn't their thing) and you go at them with a baseball bat or fists. The rights of the child are their to protect them from the abuse. The child would be removed from your care and you would be prosecuted for your actions. Now I'm not saying you would, that's just an example. But when discussion education it's important to think about the needs of a child, something that will change from person to person admittedly. When assessing the education needs of a child you must look at the world they are entering so the school can address things that will be common place in their lives, along side skills to develop them for work life and further education. Maths, English, Languages and Science are the clear objective truths which children are taught to give them the skills and knowledge they need to understand the world. Art, Design, Music, Drama, Dance, Physical Education are all more social and creative outlets children benefit from partaking it. Both for enjoyment and for the cultural aspects of them all. Religious Education however is where people differ, some want it to push certain religions onto children, some want it to exclude religions, some don't want it at all. Most people however would side with wanting it to teach a variety religions and their practices, beliefs, customs, traditions and the like without a heavy push towards any in particular. That's what should be happening in state schools which are aimed at education the general population as it needs to reflect the needs of a diverse group of people. If you want a specific education in religion (Something that could lead to poor cultural understanding in the future) you either teach that at home, go to a special school or home school your child for it. It's not the states job to push certain religions on your children.  On the topic of sex ed, again at state schools the requirement is to cater to the diverse population they deal with. That includes Gays, Lesbians, Transexuals and naturally heterosexuals. If you don't want your kids to have a full education on the topic... Home schooling and religious schools are options. Again though you do so knowing that there will be things that they will not understand when they grow up. You have a 'right' as a parent to choose what school they go to... You have an obligation as a parent to make sure they are being taught the things they need to be, even if that includes things which go against or contradict your beliefs. You have issues in America for example where they want to remove aspects of science from them to teach creation as a truth, even thought there is no evidence to support it. Wanting to remove evolution from science classes because the bible teaches creation, completely disregarding the scientific evidence for evolution, tests, facts, peer reviewed, replicated studies and tests. This is why separation of church and state is what keeps this from happening. It stops religions going into schools and applying their beliefs to the curriculum, disregarding scientific consensus and facts.   &gt;  I'm sick and tired of this aggression  Is it aggressive though?  Let's take a step back and consider this. You're in a country and a different religion is more prominent than yours. Lets say you're a Christian and majority is Sikh. Say the split is;  * 70% Sikh * 10% Christian * 10% Atheist * 10% Muslim  All the groups pay tax to the same government, all the taxes are used to fund state schools and projects. Would you be okay then with the Sikh majority being able to influence how those funds are spent? Would you be okay with them using your tax money to erect Sikh monuments on public land while disregarding the other faiths? Would you want them teaching Sikh as a true religion in schools rather than teaching a variety of religious understandings?  So the answer of is it aggressive. Nope... though I will agree terms and conditions apply:  Yes there are people who take things to far and inflict hate upon Christian groups for their beliefs as there are with every group of people. Them being dicks still doesn't make evening the playing field aggressive... that makes the people being dicks aggressive.  I can see why you might think it's ""Aggressive"" places like America and assuming Malta where you are? In a country which has for a long time now had a heavy push towards one side (Roman Catholic if Malta, Christianity in general in the US) the levelling of the playing field leads to seemingly huge changes. Especially when you don't appear to see why other groups are upset by it.  Some cases which show importantly why separation from church and state is important can ironically be shown by Americas ""Church of Satan"" which isn't actually a church for satan. When a religious group wants to impose it's views on state ran projects, using state money or the like ""Freedom of religion"" means that the state needs to treat all religions equally. When Religion groups do that Church of Satan also puts in their application... which tends to lead to the other religion stepping down (From imposing views on state/public things) not just because it's unconstitutional to do it. But because they want a monopoly on religion and don't want the Church of Satan to be able to display their beliefs.  The whole ""Families come in all different shapes and sizes"" thing once again... everyone has different beliefs on what a family is to what the people in it what it to be. You definition of family is heavily dictated by your religious views both directly and indirectly. Many people do not share the same faith as you and thus have different views on that. Other peoples views on what family means doesn't effect your family. As long as you're happy with how you and the people you love live, other people having enjoyable lives living how they want to live (Providing now one is harming anyone) will never change your families relationship. Cultures all over the World have different meanings to family and amazingly... they do just fine. From tribes in the amazon to people in America to Russians and east Asia. The concept of family changes but the consistent theme is one of love, caring, compassion and unity. The rest is cultural differences yet they all work. Just remember that just because a belief you hold is important to you... that doesn't mean that belief is right, applies to everyone around you, is well informed, is realistic or is wrong. To apply a narrow minded belief to a world of 7+ Billion vastly under estimates how varied our species is.  In addition to this. Separation of Church and State also does a lot to protect religions but that's a whole different topic all together.",europe

63003,"Here's an account of my first breakthrough Salvia experience (which is also the first trip I've ever had):          Back in 2005/06 I played around with Salvia a few times. It was legal in PA, although the main reason I was doing it was because I was already being drug tested as part of signing up for the Navy. I tried hard to get regular dried leaves to work, but I didn't really feel anything substantial until I got my hands on some 13x extract.          Set/Setting: Friend's House (Basement)   Time: Early Evening          T+0s: Took a large hit via bong of Salvia 13x extract. I looked around at my 3 friends as I held it in (we were all sitting in a circle around a candle on the floor), and I exhaled shortly after.     T+10s: Lost track of peripheral vision; candle flame began to smear; tracers accompanied movement.     T+20s: Was zoned out on a tingling sensation all over my body, along with what sounded like howling wind all around me. I saw the candle flame fall down and disappear, which briefly startled me, until I realized it was ME that was falling backwards, because gravity decided to change on me. I found this funny, so as I was falling I looked at my best friend on my right and giggled.     T+30s: I didn't know if my eyes were open or closed. I was flat on my back looking up at the ceiling, yet in my mind I was looking down through the floor I was laying on. Gravity got really heavy. I felt as if I was being sucked into a black hole. My legs and torso were stretching out like a piece of taffy, into the floor.     T+?: I lifted my neck to look at my feet, but I couldn't find them. They were already sucked into the floor, being pulled into a completely separate dimension. This dimension was cubic in shape, yet all sides stretched off into infinity. I was looking at the center of this cubic universe, from which a thin, flat ribbon stretched from one end to the center, did a loop, then continued on to the other end. Upon closer inspection I realize this ribbon was made up of tiny squares with a single dot in the middle. They resembled plant cells, yet instead of containing genetic material, these cells were the building blocks/instructions for our reality.     T+??: With horror I discovered that my body has already been stretched out all the way up to its waist, and was being sucked into this ribbon, slowly becoming a part of it. I felt for my arms, but couldn't feel them. The floor was up to the bottom of my rib cage now. I summoned every remaining ounce of strength I had left to open my eyes (I guess they were closed), look at my friends, and blurted out a weak, ""help me...,"" to which they all laughed. I then realized I was at the butt end of a universal joke.     T+???: I felt played. I was devastated. Not only was I about to stop existing, all of my friendships had been a lie. With this I silently resigned to my fate, my eyes beginning to tear up. The floor was up to my neck when suddenly...     T+?!?!: It stopped! I finally stopped being sucked into the floor! I quickly start feeling my arms and torso again, to which I promptly shot myself right up off the floor, tripped and fell over, stood up again, then nervously paced around for about a minute, afraid that if I stopped I'd be sucked back into the floor again.          Total experience time was about 5 minutes, although ever since that experience I've always had some slight level of disassociation with reality. It was so real it caused me to completely question my existence. Hell, sometimes I ponder if I'm still in the middle of the  same salvia experience to this very day. After all, time is completely meaningless on salvia.     .     .     .   .   .     ...fuck that plant.",trees

I never run out of new music because I literally have hundreds of music artists in my library, so I am essentially spinning a web library of music. Start with a few songs and Artists, and work my way out to different artists and genres.

There's rarely a genre I haven't dabbled in due to listening for new music this way.  Although I will say this, Spotify and Pandora are my least liked services for achieving a wide variety because their libraries are so small, and their radio stations are very repetitive no matter what I add to them.

13272,"Pure imagination like 3 original Star Wars movies? What about the sequel to The Godfather? Let's not get into the imagination and originality argument. You know that all of Kubrick's movies were based on books, right? So they can't be imaginative. What about fucking Shakespeare? All of his plays were based on other people's work, too. And he made sequels.   But if that's not enough why don't you take the time to consider the movies you so conveniently chose to ignore. Tree of Life and Melancholia seem pretty imaginative. Going back a couple of months we see things like Black Swan and 127 Hours that are chock full of imagination. Even Toy Story 3 was super imaginative. Basically what it comes down to is that any movie has the potential to be good (Harry Potter 7.2 is enjoying great reviews) whether it is a sequel or an adaptation or a wholly original property.

19007,"&gt; Let's take the technology ranking. You can see that the University of Toronto is 24, Waterloo 47, and McGill 76-100.  In every single ranking in every field, the best Canadian university is lower on the list than several American universities. There isn't a single broad subject in higher education in which Canadian universities outperform American universities.   &gt; One thing about university rankings is that the universities at the top are virtually indistinguishable from one another because they're all so good.  Utter nonsense. They're apparently not indistinguishable considering there aren't many spots where universities tie. The ranking system I linked to does allow for ties though. If it were the case that all those universities at the top are equal, then there'd be more ties.  [Let's look at the field of physics.](http://www.shanghairanking.com/SubjectPhysics2015.html)  The US has almost all the top spots. Canada's best university, the University of Toronto, is in 44th place. Are you saying that the University of Toronto is actually just as good as the top universities like Harvard and Princeton? To make that assertion would indicate that you're either incredibly delusional or willfully dishonest.  You seem pretty desperate for mental gymnastics to obfuscate and explain away facts that you don't like. Canadians are so accustomed to hearing nothing but negatives about the US and positives about Canada, that when someone provides evidence that shows the US outperforms Canada in a certain area, Canadians basically wig out and can't rationally and sanely respond to it.  &gt; the average Canadian university is better than the average American university.  Lol. Let's translate: ""Even though American universities lead the world in every field, I'm going to warp the nuance of the discussion and boldly claim that, according to my own metrics, Canadian universities are ACTUALLY better, because that's what I want to be true and what I want bedevils my sense of reality!""  &gt; Fact is, Canada's higher education system is world-class and has nothing to envy to America's.  Canadians have such an all-encompassing, overcompensated inferiority complex that dominates their perception of reality so strongly, that they can't admit anything positive about the US. If a subject doesn't allow you to pretend you're better than the US, your brain shuts off.    ",worldnews

The return of Sigourney Weaver to the franchise would build a lot of hype. Fox could probably force a decent screenwriter to work with Blomkamp so the dialogue isn't shit.

The new national obsession with completionism and instant gratification is unhealthy and kind of strange. writing and publishing a novel is a job, and completing that is worth some money if people are willing to pay it. there can be subjective assessments of how well that novel stands on its own, but acting like the promise of future installments makes anything less than 100% of the promise meaningless is silly.  Basically, if you enjoyed the first book, or the first five books, then nobody but you can take that enjoyment away.  and reading the book in the first place was certainly your choice, presumably done with the full knowledge that it was part of a proposed cycle. if you consider that to be ""taking a risk,"" then it's entirely your responsibility.

I'd be interested to see what might have been created if his ideas were more included into the mix. He did write the Blackened riff, so he was off to a pretty fucking epic start. Later, I don't know if it was only the bass lines or if it was more, but also My Friend of Misery, and devil's dance, and a few others.   By comparison, (and I say this with ton of respect and admiration to Kirk and him being my idol as a kid and the reason I picked up a guitar) Kirk as far as I know has pretty much only contributed the ""die"" riff on creeping death and hit a mega home run with enter sandman. Obviously, he wrote solos to pretty much every song, more than a few of which are legendary too.   The interesting thing about all that to me is not that it's a lack of creativity or skill by them, but the awe of the amount and quality of riffs that come out of James.

23877,"UBI isn't just because of automation. Part of it is the idea that you get rid of a ton of separate welfare programs (tax deduction here, credit there, reduced bill for this and that, a cheque being mailed for this, a different one for that, etc) and just institute 1 simple program that gives everyone some simple-to-calculate sum of money to spend as they like.  Supposedly the simplified administrative burden would reduce costs, and the other benefit is that often people know what they need better than the government. IE maybe some people who qualify for food stamps but not for electricity assistance would be better off the other way around because they grow their own food but their electricity bill is absurd. UBI just gives them the money and lets them decide.  Of course that means some people will spend food-stamp money on drugs instead but the thinking is they might not if they had enough money to really feel like they can turn their life around and didn't feel discouraged.  Obviously the above is up for debate, but it's part of the justification for UBI, alongside the idea that automation will inevitably reduce the number of jobs available (which is also up for debate, so far automation has created new jobs while making some obsolete).  So if the point is to just reduce the administrative costs and to give money instead of food-stamps or bill reductions, then tying the way you get money back into taxes accomplishes those goals as long as we make the tax code behave like a UBI (ie you always get X amount of money back regardless of your income).",conspiracy

Now I don't know if you know, but Canada is the second largest country in the world, nearly 40 times larger than the UK. We also have about half the population of that country.  Now most people don't consider this but every competing cellphone company does need to set up infrastructure to be able to provide coverage to the consumers. Given that the country is so large and the population density is scarce when compared to a country like the UK, its easy to see that there would be a significantly larger maintenance cost for the big 3 to be able to operate.  The UK has a population density of 255 people/KM^2.   Canada has a poulation density of 3 people /KM^2.  So if I were to build a radio tower that covers 50km in either country, I'd have a little over 10,000 potential customers in the UK and less than 200 potential customers in Canada per tower. ___  TL;DR - Things cost money and the people in the UK (and every other small EURO country we get compared to monthly) get a better bang for their buck because of population density and lower maintenance costs due to their countries size.",canada

It turned Gabriel into Reaper and Jack into Soldier 76 and we know virtually *nothing* about it.  Did Gabe already have that ability to turn himself into nanite smoke? If not: How did he get it? Who gave it to him? Talon? But then, how can Reaper have been sighted for decades when the explosion happened about 5 years ago? What made him so bitter about Overwatch? Was he maybe brainwashed like Widowmaker?  And why is Jack so jaded? Why would he looking for the people responsible for the fall of Overwatch if he *knew* that it was Gabriel?  Did Gabe let Jesse go or even tell him to get out? How the hell did Jesse McCree rack up a 6 Mill bounty? What about Genji?  What role did Mercy play? THere is a voiceline ingame that insinuates she should know what happened to Reaper?  And so on.   But the most important is the explosion and the question did he or did he not?  Because if Reaper did not, then who did and why was Gabriel caught in it? Maybe he DID go back and tried to save Jack and heck, maybe even succeeded. He sure as hell didn't seem surprised to see him in Egypt. So what if he saved Jack and Jack as usual got the preferential treatment, got saved and taken care of (who saved Jack?) and Gabriel got left behind to die.  Reason enough to be that pissed of?",Overwatch

6220," Beyonce is a performance artist and singer. She has never alluded to otherwise. It takes talent and hard work to sing, dance, and perform the way she does - other wise a lot more people would do it and she wouldn't be paid millions to do so.   Those people who credit Beyonce for the whole song are making assumptions by their own volition. The people who write and produce the songs for Beyonce know full well they don't get the full prestige of credit but they get credit in other ways such as money contracts to produce for other performers.   If nobody performed their work then they wouldn't get paid so they sell it to people who *can* perform the songs. It's a symbiotic relationship. Who would go see a writer go up on stage and read their work even if they don't have the talent of singing? Many producers also D.J so they *can* receive credit for their work that way as well. With the rise of techno/electronica/dubstep etc. this has been a popular way for producers to get famous.  But by and large, people prefer singing and performing to the technical aspects of the production. This applies to everything that has ""face."" Someone designed the McDonald's Arches but you never hear about them? Why don't they get credit for their artwork?  Furthermore, I don't see why you would divorce singing from the concept of art by way of necessitating that everyone who sings *must* also write their songs in order to be considered an artist.   Led Zeppelin, Elvis, and a lot of other rock 'n' roll musicians blatantly stole their music from blues musicians yet these blues musicians hardly get credited which is admittedly unfair.   What I'm saying is that people don't care who wrote a dance hit. They just want to dance and sing along which is fine. Writers and producers who otherwise aren't inclined to perform get to be paid for their music and see it performed. Both the performers of the music as well as the designers of it are artists just in different ways that support each other.   ",Music

Would the majority of r/NFL take him over Jim Brown, Barry Sanders, or Walter Payton? I doubt it.   I think ypc and ypg are better stats especially when looking at prime seasons.  Emmitt only averaged over 5 yards a carry once, Sanders did it for half of his career. Emmitt was a great back but because we tend to talk about potential goats and not the top 5 or 6 he rarely gets mentioned.

At this point, it might not even be enough to fend off the police force. It just seems like asking for a pocket knife in case a rhino attacks you.

Sérgio Buarque de Hollanda, his father, was a well-known historian and sociologist.  Aurélio Buarque de Hollanda, his lexicographer uncle, is as strongly associated with Brazilian dictionaries as Webster is with American English ones.   &gt; He was a studious child, precocious in music &amp; writing, and was heavily impressed by bossa nova - specifically, João Gilberto's work.  &gt; Chico made his public debut as musician and composer in 1964, rapidly building his reputation at music festivals and television variety shows. His self-titled debut album exemplified the work to come, with catchy sambas characterized by inventive wordplay and an undercurrent of nostalgic tragedy.  &gt; Chico's increasing political activity against the Brazilian military dictatorship resulted in his arrest in 1968, and eventual self-exile to Italy in 1969. Other important musicians like Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil experienced the same fate. Chico returned to Brazil in 1970, using his fame and song-writing skills to protest against the dictatorship. At this time his lightly-veiled protest single Apesar de Você (Despite you) somehow passed by the gaze of military censors, becoming the democracy movement's anthem. After selling over 100,000 copies, the single was eventually repressed, and all copies were removed from the market. Despite the censorship, songs such as Samba de Orly (Samba of Orly; 1970), Acorda Amor (Wake Up, Darling; 1974), and Vai Passar (It Will Pass; 1983) made Chico's continuing opposition blatant.  &gt; During the 1970s and 1980s, Chico collaborated with filmmakers, playwriters, and musicians in further protest works against the dictatorship.  &gt; In 1998, the carnival samba school Mangueira took Chico as its annual theme, winning first prize.  &gt; His latest book, Budapeste, achieved great critical acclaim and won the Prêmio Jabuti, a Brazilian literary award similar to The Booker Prize Award.

Her music often blends elements of pop, indie rock and electronic; various instruments can also be found in her songs, including violins, synthesizers, tambourines, trumpets, saxophones and cellos. Li possesses the vocal range of a soprano.  &gt; Li was raised by artistic parents (her mother was a photographer, her father is a musician). As a toddler the family moved to Stockholm. Later she lived in Portugal for five years and spent winters in Nepal and India. At one point, she worked as a dancer on Swedish TV.  &gt; Li had her first success with the EP ""Little Bit"" in 2007. She later released her debut album, Youth Novels, on LL Recordings in the Nordic region on 30 January 2008, prior to a wider European release in June of the same year. The album was produced by Björn Yttling (of Peter Bjorn and John) and Lasse Mårtén. It was released in the United States on 19 August 2008.  &gt; On 1 March 2011, she released her sophomore effort Wounded Rhymes on her own label LL Recordings. Read more on Last.fm.

This section in the OP is particularly bad (I'm not afraid to call it bad) for reasons pertaining to shown character traits of these characters.  1st: Lucoa and Tohru are not friends. They act in a civil manner because Tohru - usually extremely confrontational and territorial - doesn't want to anger Ms. Kobayashi. Lucoa really doesn't give a fuck one way or the other. They aren't the same species (let alone the same faction), have disimilar sexual interests (one is a canon lesbian and the other is totally unknown or nothing at all) (really hoping Lucoa isn't into *little* boys), and nothing in their daily lives relates to the other (Tohru is literally a maid while Lucoa is guest of honour with her/the boy's family). Tohru has little reason to like her other than the fact that they came from the same world and hasn't sided with her in an argument in the series' run.  2nd: Lucoa *really* doesn't give a fuck. Not about Shota, not about the dragons (good to remember she isn't one), and especially not about humans. The world around her (from her perspective) pretty much exists to entertain her. Nothing more. She has no reason to care about standards placed on her by humans.   This to add to the fact that the dub's rhetoric, while it does exist in some areas of the world, do not nessecarily  (and from a gaijin's perspective, *do not*) exist in Japan. There isn't the history of active, open discrimination that there is/was (or in the way there is/was) in the (post)colonial world. Japan never had a Stonewall or the riots that happened around it. They just adopted (marriage) laws similar to the West (read: USA) in order to look more like the rich (read: Western) countries, and that unfortunately included not giving LGB people the same marriage rights.

40347,"Tbh I was never a real fan of those half wingers. Sadly Reus is almost always injured. I think Draxler can be a very good winger. Draxler made a good step forward he had a long low phase after his very good start at Schalke. I also think Ter Stegen did very good in the tournament so I don't think Neuer would have had that much impact. Still a very huge difference between Ter Stegen and Neuer.  With Boateng-Hummels-Kroos I agree. As I said I see them kinda as the heart. Also Werner was very good. However I wonder why you don't list Stindl? Mueller is Mueller but he is hard to fit in a system. The thing is with Reus/Draxler on the wings I can see Müller playing a position that fits him well. About the rest I'm not sure. Oezil is a great player for example but sometimes he just goes invisible.  Alot of people say Germany won with a total 'B' 11 but I still think most of them are very good players and was just overlooked for a long time and could be contender for the starting spots.  Yes, qualifiers may mean less but France and Spain struggled with consistency. How do you explain what happened Spain 2014?

Everything besides the highest tier raid bosses can be done with every specc in the game.  As for your question. On a singletarget fight the feral is a little stronger but not much. As soon as you get to multiple targets the balance will be much stronger though.  Also moonkin is a range DPS which has a lot of benefits and you don't have to fight for the few open melee spots.,wow

A simple look at the stats should be enough to tell you it isn't a subset.  Hell, they don't even draw from the same dataset, and you probably shouldn't go around talking shit on people's understanding of stats if you don't know that.  Besides from the fact they have completely different weighting, PER draws from a *subset dataset* of BPM (BPM has minute adjustments and opponent performance adjustments), while BPM makes a metric fuckton of additional estimations by drawing from advanced stats.  Does adding more stats make BPM a better stat?  No, of course not.  I can run a regression on what the player ate for breakfast a day ago, two days ago, three, etc. and add arbitrary values to food items and see what sticks.  Does that necessarily have any bearing on its predictive value?  No way.

8881,"It's hard to say, really. I don't have much experience judging game's lifespans.   The devs seem to think this game will go on for many years; that's understandable, since they're the ones behind this, and they likely want to keep it going for as long as possible. They also want people to think and feel like it's going to go on for a while, too, which is important: once people start thinking en masse 'yeah, Overwatch is starting to die', the vibe may spread fast and people may gravitate away from it as the 'feeling' that it's dying / dead sits, regardless of what the devs may be doing at the time to try to keep the game fresh and interesting.   Overwatch has been in people's sight and minds since launch; since way before launch, really. The game itself and everything surrounding it has been going very strong for the last year and almost a month. However, some people have already shown signs of fatigue (some of those who played from launch and finally got tired from playing too often, those who see it everywhere and just weren't much a fan to begin with and want it out of their faces, etc.). It's hard to say if those kinds of people are even having that big of an impact on people's views and opinions of the game.   I'd like to think that it'll last for a long time; I just don't know what 'a long time' is, and it's weird trying to pinpoint that. Part of me feels like it'll last a year more; part of me feels like it very well could go for a couple more years. I really don't know. There's too many variables to keep note of to accurately say how long it'll last.   When I said 'we could use 2-3 more healer heroes over the course of the game's lifespan', that was me assuming it'd go for another, say, 2-3 years max. That was also me factoring how many heroes max this game would seem right with. But that was just a spur-of-the-moment thought. I really don't know how long it could last. ",Overwatch

64598,"That would depend on the court and their relations with their subjects. It's not true that pagans had no rights under Sharia in general. Medieval Islamic law organised society around castes with Islam at the top, followed by the Abrahamic religions which were afforded special considerations, to pagans and atheists at the bottom. The way the caste system was configured allowed for upward mobility towards increasingly priviliged beliefs, but disallowed what was perceived as regression. Their rights were more limited and as a whole they had to submit to Islamic rule, but nonetheless they had rights, they were subjects with some legal standing. There are historical precedents for pagans even achieving protected status as dhimmis as well. The Chaldaean pagans, which practiced some weird quasi-Indo Hellenstic Babylonian astrology, are one example. Obviously there was a preference for pagans to convert to Islam, something which was often not true for the standard protected religions. Very similar to contemporary Christian thinking of the time, paganism was seen as a deviation from religious truth. The very first Dhimmi contract, the Constitution of Medina, included pagans as to having rights. Later developments were not charitable.  As for idolatry, every major monotheistic religious institution looked to it as a form of heresy, a subversive reversal backwards to paganism that corrupts the purity of the religion. Thus they were heavily persecuted within Islam, as was the custom of the time. What's quite interesting is that because of the mobility mechanism, religious uniformity was policed also in the protected minorities to ensure that they would not slide backwards into pagan elements themselves. Minorities which already practiced idolatry were allowed to continue to do so in accordance with their customs, unless they were targetted for conversion.",canada

Wouldnt be shocked if Koivu has a bit of a down year and with Parise looking like he cant stay healthy now theyre gonna need the young guys to pick up the slack especially Grandlund Nino and Zucker.   Dallas's defense isnt as sexy as Nashville's but if Bishop could do what Niemi and Lehtonen couldnt and keep them in games they are a lock imo for a spot. Only thing that sticks out is how old spezza is and that forwards age like milk when theyre 34-36  St.Louis I feel I dont know enough about their players to make a real statement  Nashville imo didnt really get better but they didnt really get worse. Losing Neal and Fisher sucks and Bonino has more of a rep as a playoff warrior over a regular season and Hartnell is 36. Their defense is still juicy as fuck though and RV still has room to improve.  Chicago is gonna be a one we all will argue over but I think they can still make the playoffs. Saad for Panarin is basically an 70pt player for a 60pt player with an allround better game for the team. Kane may not be in the Art Ross hunt but I think he can still be PPG since he already has been with no 2C and without a decent LW his entire career. Toews I think will get a decent boost offensively with Saad and could likely get 65pts. Murphy I never watched enough of him but I think playing with Keith can do him some good maybe not replace hammer but at least lessen the blow of it. What people seem to forget is Schmaltz, Hartman, Forsling will likely improve and be better than last season especially Schmaltz who was really good the 2nd half and helped Toews go on a tear.

Spaceman, after the spectacular demise of the Spacemen 3 outfit. The membership of Spiritualized changes from album to album, with Pierce being the only constant factor.  &gt; The first Spiritualized release was a space rock-esque cover of Any Way That You Want Me in 1990, a record which heralded the official split of Spacemen 3 following contractual wrangles over the band's name. Of the final Spacemen 3 line up, bassist Will Carruthers, drummer Jonny Mattock and session guitarist Mark Refoy joined Pierce in the first phase of Spiritualized (for the debut LP, Lazer Guided Melodies), alongside his then girlfriend Kate Radley. None of the original line up remains - Carruthers tried for a solo career, Mattock played for a spell in The Breeders (and later Lupine Howl), Refoy formed Slipstream(his replacement was John Coxon) and Radley married Richard Ashcroft of The Verve. A later cohort of Spiritualized backing musicians - Sean Cook, Damon Reece and Michael Mooney - formed Lupine Howl following summary dismissal by Pierce.  &gt; Sax player Ray 'Moonshake' Dickaty was added to the lineup in 1997, and Gregg Hale (guitar) also augmented the band in 1997 and 1998.  &gt; Retaining only keyboardist Thighpaulsandra (keyboards)a replacement for Kate Radley, Jason Pierce then debuted a new (and current) line up of Spiritualized, introducing classical percussionist Tom Edwards and former Julian Cope string arranger Martin Schellard on bass guitar. Completing the new Spiritualized line-up were guitarist Doggen of Brain Donor and the Julian Cope band, and drummer Kevin 'Kevlar' Bales who is also ex-Julian Cope band. Ray Dickaty departed in 2003, quitting to play in the free-jazz Solar Fire Trio. The remaining line-up finished recording the album Songs In A&amp;E in Nottingham and London.  &gt; The musical style of Spiritualized can perhaps be best described as psychedelic rock, especially earlier albums like Lazer Guided Melodies and Pure Phase, which also incorporated elements of the shoegazing style made popular by influential 1991 album Loveless. The landmark Ladies And Gentlemen We Are Floating In Space showed influences from African-American gospel and blues beginning to creep in, and wall of sound influences from Phil Spector and Brian Wilson began to predominate, which came to a head on Let It Come Down. Amazing Grace favoured a more stripped down sound with the gospel, blues, and soul influences heavier than ever.  &gt; For several years (ending in or about 1999), Spiritualized were the only active artist signed to Dedicated Records, a British independent label which had, by then, been acquired by Spiritualized's then-label, Arista Records.  &gt; On 15 June 1997, Spiritualized became the last band to play at Factory Records' Manchester nightclub The Haçienda.  &gt; After several years of work and Pierce's serious illness in July 2005,the album, Songs in A&amp;E was released on 26 May 2008 in the UK, and on 27 May 2008 in the US. The first single from the 18-track album was ""Soul On Fire"". The release was backed by an Electric Mainlines UK tour which began in May. Pierce has also scored Harmony Korine's 2008 film Mister Lonely.  &gt; In October and December 2009 the band performed 1997's Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space live in its entirety as part of the All Tomorrow's Parties-curated Don't Look Back series.  &gt; After more than two years in the making, while Pierce was undergoing experimental chemotherapy for a liver disease, and including a year long period of mixing, Sweet Heart Sweet Light was released in April 2012, on Double Six Records. The band had already played some of this new material over the past 3 years but not much else was known about the content of the album. The album cover, an octagon surrounding the word ""Huh?"" on a plain white background, is a reference to the working title of the album. In an interview regarding the new release it was revealed that the album would ""embrace"" more poppy songs compared to previous albums. In the same interview, Jason Pierce also said that the album was partly inspired by the experiences of performing Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space live in its entirety.

On May 13th, 2016, Agalloch announced their disbandment. John Haughm released the following statement regarding the status of Agalloch:  &gt; ""After being inundated by a barrage of responses, I feel that I should clarify some things. I take full responsibility for the decision to part ways with the other guys. It was difficult, well thought-out, and something that had been culminating over the past couple of years. I simply could not continue any further with the band as it was. I had to make a change as my motivation and inspiration had started to completely deteriorate. Whether this is the permanent end of Agalloch altogether or a possible fresh start, I don't know. I probably won't know for awhile. The band has simply been reduced back to its founding, visionary member for the first time in 20 years. Beyond that, the future is unknown.""  &gt; For twenty years the Pacific Northwest group defined what it means to combine influences from a variety of musical genres into one brooding, colossal, and cinematic sound that provides the soundtrack to existential themes concerning man, nature, loss, and death.  &gt; After two demo releases in the late 90s the band released three full-length albums: Pale Folklore (1999), The Mantle (2002), and Ashes Against the Grain (2006). “The Mantle” has since been heralded as a classic for having been one of the first albums to combine elements from black metal, neo-folk, progressive rock, post-rock, and ambient music. The influence of this record can be heard in many so-called “post-black metal” bands today.  &gt; In 2008 Agalloch began re-releasing their demos, B-sides, and EPs under their own Dammerung Arthouse label. In 2010 their fourth album Marrow of the Spirit made number one on numerous critic’s top ten lists. In between each of these full-lengths the band pushed on the flexible boundaries they had developed around themselves through a series of EPs that found the band experimenting with post-rock/instrumental rock (The Grey, 2004), neo-folk/psychedelic folk (“The White EP, 2008) and a mammoth twenty-minute epic work entitled Faustian Echoes (2012) released through Dammerung Arts. Their fifth and last full-length album The Serpent &amp; the Sphere (2014) has continued to earn praise for solidifying the now identifiable sound of the band.  &gt; Agalloch earned a reputation for explosive and emotional live performances. They sold out tours across Europe and the US and played a variety of major international festivals including: Roadburn, Inferno, Ragnarok, Tomahawk, Noctis, Asymmetry Fest, Maryland Deathfest, Scion Fest and others. The band took special care constructing the environment of each and every show with wood, incense, and imagery taken directly from their home in the Northwest. Such care made an Agalloch show more than just a typical heavy metal concert.  &gt; Agalloch - Bandcamp Agalloch - Dämmerung Arts Agalloch - Discogs Agalloch - Facebook Agalloch - Official Site Agalloch - RateYourMusic Agalloch - Store Agalloch - Twitter  &gt; ---Discography------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  &gt; Studio albums: 1999 - Pale Folklore 2002 - The Mantle 2006 - Ashes Against the Grain 2010 - Marrow of the Spirit 2014 - The Serpent &amp; the Sphere  &gt; EPs: 1997 - From Which of This Oak (demo) 1998 - Promo 1998 (demo) 2001 - Of Stone, Wind and Pillor 2003 - Tomorrow Will Never Come 2004 - The Grey EP 2004 - Agalloch / Nest (split with Nest) 2008 - The White EP 2012 - Faustian Echoes  &gt; Compilations: 2008 - The Demonstration Archive 1996-1998 2010 - The Compendium Archive  &gt; Singles: 2004 - A Fragment (Second Phase) 2010 - Nebelmeer (split with Mathias Grassow) 2010 - Fragment 4 2010 - Scars of the Shattered Sky 2010 - Where Shade Once Was 2011 - The Death of Man III 2011 - The Wolves of Timberline 2013 - Nihil Totem 2013 - The Weight of Darkness 2014 - Alpha Serpentis (Unukalhai) Read more on Last.fm.

What is with some people's hard-on for Putin like he's some sort of hero?   &gt;Democrats have been demonizing Russia very badly recently.  This line is repeated so much it's ridiculous. Mitt Romney was running against Obama saying that Obama was too weak against Russia, if you don't recall. Obama, the Democratic president, tried to ""reset relations"" with Russia during his first term.   The Democrats have had a firm stance against Russia for two reasons: The election hacking and espionage efforts against the US elections and US itself.   And the Russian attempts at interfering in the EU and attempting to destabilize Europe, culminating in actions like bribing the Ukranian president to turn down a popularly supported EU-trade deal in favor for a Russian-Ukraine deal.   This then led to a protest-turned uprising which unseated that government, and served as Putin's justification to invade Ukraine and annex Ukrainian territory and providing anti-air missiles to rebels which led to a civilian airliner getting shot-down.   &gt;and make someone else do WWIII  No one is pushing for war with Russia that I'm aware of.

20555,"Hey, hate to be the buzzkill here since I'm not suggesting Annie. I'm no master of league but a good champ to main is Talon because there's not much that he lacks. To give a few pros:  * High mobility - his Q is a gap closer that, with decent decision making, helps you reach the right targets (especially since it's point-click). His E is quite literally parkour that can be used for gap closing and escaping, and though it has internal cooldowns, makes for a very useful ability if used properly, hence the maining aspect. If it's any use, his ult gives him bonus MS (scaling with rank) that lets you either position on a carry or run from a fight, both of which you can use frequently since the cooldown is low late game.  * Waveclear - this is has been debated for a while (at least in my circles) but since his W is AoE, it helps with the tried and true shove and roam technique. He clears minion waves pretty quick so in a few match ups you're free to push out and roam (more on this later). In match ups where you get pushed in, W allows you to clear from a relatively (relative to opponent champ's range) safe distance. It's a useful tool for CS'ing when you're new to him too.  * Kill potential - this is pretty straightforward; During the early game, he has insane (and often unexpected) amount of burst with his level 2 and level 6 all-in's because of his bleed passive and the damage you get in one spell rotation, coupled with auto attacks which hurt. If you were to run ignite against a squishy mid lane opponent, it's nearly almost guaranteed that you will either get a kill at level 2/6 or at the very least a summoner spell or two. As a side note, his W-Q combo is pretty good poke early and using only his W gets you good poke onto a target. He spikes midgame and 100-0 anyone maybe other than a (fed) tank. He wears down tanks too over time but usually sustain beats burst so your job anyway is pretty much to delete the carries in a fight or pick them out. Late game he falls off a bit, like other traditional assassins but his burst and one shot potential is still pretty good on squishies and if you get the ADC or fed mage, you win the fight.   * Variable playstyles (in the laning phase) - again, pretty debatable, feel free to correct me wherever you think I'm wrong, but Talon can be played in a couple of styles. The most common is where you focus on roaming and pretty much shove and roam all throughout laning phase to either help get other lanes ahead or get yourself a kill or two to start the snowball. Talon has really good roaming potential cause of his kit and it's insane how easy it is to get that first kill in bot lane. It also helps that he snowballs very hard and can often use that to his advantage in lane and out of lane; one kill is enough for you to carry up to the mid game and stay relevant in the late game (after all you only have to delete the squishies). The other is to focus only on your lane and try to go even in CS and maybe get a kill in lane or an advantage to have the opponent fall behind. I'm sure there are more ways to play him, just not going to list them all or else this will get longer than it already is. Now I'm not saying that all the playstyles are the most efficient, but just putting it out there that Talon has different playstyles that you can use depending on how you like to play. In all cases though, it would be about trying your best to snowball a lead so you hit your spike faster (which is kind of the meta way of winning now) and if you don't, it's okay because you tend to stay relevant throughout the game. I would refer to [r/talonmains](https://reddit.com/r/talonmains) for this.  * Meta - Talon manages to stay a good or decent pick in every meta (obviously player skill should be taken into account too) and only sometimes does he feel really weak, like when lethality was nerfed and when it was released. Right now though, he sits at a 52% winrate and the lethality buffs and the change to its scaling has made it perfect for snowbally solo laners such as him. He even builds duskblade which at the time of writing is pretty broken.  Cons:  * Tough/unfavorable matchups - the current mid meta favors ranged mages that have some form of utility and damage or some poke such as Orianna (never a bad time to pick her lol), Syndra, Corki. One of the biggest counters to Talon (and every assassin in general) is CC so anyone with some form of it makes it just a bit tough for you to play against. This is where 'farming with W' comes in. Since you're melee it makes it pretty easy for a lot of mages to poke you down so that makes laning a bit hard and hence why roaming is a better option. Don't take it that heavily though cause his laning is still better than a lot of assassins.  * Team reliance - yes you can carry the game with him quite well if you master him but since he's an assassin, it's easy to block him out of a fight if the opponent team is coordinated. You need your team to help you get to the right people and since it's solo q, that gets slightly tough. In lane, you need jungle pressure often because you get pushed in relatively easy by mages and usually that also means they put themselves in danger which is potential to net you a kill in case you do get your jungler to gank.  To conclude, it's nice to have that Talon is pretty fun to play and has huge carry potential in a meta where the outcome depends on how well you do early and midgame. He's also relatively easy to pick up and somewhat tough to master but you reap the benefits of doing so anyway.  EDIT: Formatting",leagueoflegends

At that point I was about 870 and I could get into NH normal and some heroics. Then just 2 more weeks another legendary, hit 900 and joined tomb groups. I've only done the first 4 bosses of tomb on heroic and I've cleared normal tomb twice.   I just wasn't too picky about groups and on weekends there would be groups that said AP farm or ""viewer raid"" and I would just apply and usually they could get past the first few bosses and there would be people higher ilvl then me I would just ask if they needed drops. This past week I definitely got really lucky, I went from 905 to 914 because I picked up 6 pieces of loot between normal and heroic tomb.    Highest M+ keys I have done are 8 and 9. But when I was 890 I was doing 2-4. Broken shore for war supply turn ins was the best method I found and do invasions and the goblin treasure quest chain.   Oh and about joining groups don't just apply to groups that are already 2/4/8 or something. Everyone applies to them and chances are if you actually need the loot you aren't getting in. I would sign up for 0/2/5 groups and things like that and just do something else while they filled. Those groups tend to not have as many people applying to them and can't afford to be as picky about who they let in.",wow

8677,"I don't believing in harming other living things if it is not necessary.  However I believe something being 'necessary' is a contextual decision, and one that there is no absolute standard for. Under any given hypothetical, a decision could unnecessary or necessary based on the circumstances.   What motivation would I have to treat a cognitive alien species in the same manner as I do livestock? If those circumstances dictated it was necessary, I would not find it immoral. Appending the terms 'alien' and 'cognitive' to a species in no way changes my position on how to treat them.   I'll side step your denial of God  since there can be no productive (in as much as any discussion is productive) fruit from that line of discussion. The thrust of that passage was to point out that humans have evolved to eat and the eating of meat critical (based on studies done by anthropologist) to our success as a species and the development of cognizance.   Every dietary association agrees that a 'well managed and informed' vegetarian diet can be healthy at all stages of life. Unfortunately those qualifiers (used explicitly and specifically in scientific papers) disqualify the vast majority of the population from ever falling under the umbrella of those studies (aka those studies are not credible evidence that there is not necessarity to kill animals in order to eat them) . The average  omnivorous human does not have a 'well managed and informed' diet, so the studies done about the '1%' of vegans are not scientifically viable to he used to generalize for the general population. A basic understanding of statistics would show that studies that target specific, self-selecting populations are not useful science for generalizing the behaviors of a larger population.   So even in spite of my (relative) ignorance on this specific field, I can look at the population sizes of the studies done (one study had ~140 people across the entirety of Ireland) and see they are bad science.   Any good scientist should be skeptical of any result, especially in today's academic atmosphere of 'publish or perish' and significantly misrepresented statistics.   In short, there is still a necessity for killing animals, and that is to eat them. Killing animals in order to eat them is not immoral (as opposed to killing them for sport  or for trophies).    The presence of a brain and a central nervous system are not required for sentience. If you're using some specific, exhaustive definition you need to share it so we can use like terms (and to keep you from moving the goal post) . I already define sentience as 'the ability to feel or perceive things' and then provided the evidence that organic plant matter possesses these capabilities.   I have no idea what a Chalmers is (Google says he is a philosopher?). I'm not sure what point you're trying to reach here.   You realize that plants also react to their environment and nutritional needs? Is it because you lack the ability to perceive their responses that you think they don't have one? I assure you if a plant is lacking in water or nutrients you can visually identify that through changes in the plants structure/appearance.   If neither law nor religion is a framework through which to discuss morals, then how can any moral decision have any foundation? To be more specific, how do you decide that an action is moral or immoral (excluding any religious or law based factors)? Are you arguing for the *innate morality * of an act? I have already demonstrated that absolute morality is fallacious.   I mean literally by definition, when slavery was legal it was acceptable. In fact, there are moral systems (not yours obviously but other such systems exist) that still allow slavery. While most of these systems have disappeared (and those that do have never allowed colonial style slavery in the first place) some still exist and are wildly popular. I assume by 'acceptable' you meant morally acceptable, in which case yes there is morally acceptable slavery (for me personally). Since your moral system has no foundation (except your personal fiat) I laugh in the face of your judgement.   Colonial style slavery is morally unacceptable, but that is because of the way that the slaves were treated, not because of any innately immorality of a slave system. The foundation of my moral system is God, and he allows it. The foundation of your moral system (such as it is) appears to be you, and you don't allow it. I know who I will listen to. ",funny

When it isn't being hilarious, it may be a bit dark, but it is never grim.  If you liked *Full Metal Alchemist*, give *Full Metal Panic* a try. It is nothing like *Full Metal Alchemist*, it is a mecha action romantic comedy that for mysterious reasons has a similar name. And it is a great series. There are large metal people shaped thingies in it however, so you won't be entirely lost.  If you liked *Deathnote*, then you might like *Potemayo* as it has a cute little death ray shooting demon/shinigami character in the supporting cast. I don't think anyone dies, but several characters become very embarrassed in the course of the series. However, I feel I must warn you, there is some pee pee. Alternately you might try *Hare + Guu*, which has an all powerful liminal being that makes a poor normal boy's life a living hell.  My point is, anime has an incredible level of diversity.

It is about a couple of young boys who set out to become the authors of a manga that inspires a hit anime series. Think of it as a fictionalized ""Making of Deathnote"" documentary.  Meta, no?

Usually the team has more coordination and you can try to play around them for a decent experience.

24335,"&gt; That sewer scene was Bev fighting back, and triumphing, over all of the horror her father (and It) has been inflicting on her through the whole story.     No it wasn't. It was reducing Bev to a sexual object. Eleven year old girls don't ""fight back and triumph"" over fears of their emerging sexuality by deciding to have full-on penetrative sex with all their male friends at once. That doesn't fucking happen.    You know what an 11 year old girl in Bev's situation *would* do? She would make the first move and kiss the boy she likes. Maybe hold his hand. THE END.     In the context of the book, that would have worked fine for Bev facing her fears. For her to give voice and action to her and Bill's budding feelings for each other would have been a very brave and scary and *plausible* thing for a eleven year old girl to do. Plus, it could have acted as a ""steeling"" moment for Bill, the defacto leader of their little gang, that gives him the ability to lead them out of the sewers.

It's been a while but this looks like a good summary: https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8cdc/f4d05e88627cd844bcde7a4947d212170635.pdf.   The protocol includes the need for preserving anonymity, voters being able to verify after the fact that their vote was counted and was tabulated accurately. It doesn't cover (or at least my implementation didn't) verifying the box was empty - the intent being that the system would ensure that by tabulating how many ballots were issued, how many were not cast and doing the appropriate math. You can definitely manipulate that as an election official perhaps but you can do that with paper ballots too.   Education on this is harder, I agree but doing things like allowing folks to login and verify their vote was counted would go a long way to help with that.",europe

67315,"&gt;Secret #2. But more profoundly, he discovered that he could influence brain waves if precisely timed with a return training signal. He had no idea that at this moment in history, he had accidentally destroyed democracy as we envision it to be. The military and surveillance community immediately picked up on the patent and within two years had reprogrammed their communications and surveillance satellites and terrestrial phased arrays with the new concepts. The rapid deployment of this technology occurred because it only required software changes in already existing radar, imaging, and communications’ terrestrial dishes and satellites. Many additional spy satellites have been launched since to bolster the system. So in 1976, on the bicentennial of this great nation, a system called TAMI was born. TAMI is an acronym for “Thought Amplifier and Mind Interface”. A more invasive “Big Brother” technology came about before George Orwell’s prediction of 1984.  &gt;The global system, TAMI, can hone in on a compatible mind and instantly be able to manipulate it to some varying degree dependent upon many factors. The offense practices their trade by influencing people near a targeted individual to convey information only pertinent to them, for spy games. These people are everyday citizens unfamiliar with this high technology. The effects are so subtle without lots of training to detect, nobody would be the wiser. They would at most just question why they did that or felt the need to say that.   http://thoughtlessness23.blogspot.com.au/",conspiracy
